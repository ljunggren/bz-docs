Transcript for [Boozang Feature: Execute as single action to speed up tests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRhM3dUovCQ) by [Merlin](https://merlin.foyer.work/)

 the next feature i want to talk about is
 execute as a single action
 we've supported for about a year the
 ability to execute a group of actions as
 a single action that greatly speeds up
 performance and this would be both when
 you're debugging an ide
 and when you're running it on your ci
 server so this is a great performance
 improvement but we wasn't 100 sure that
 it would always work and we notice now
 that very often this is very stable so
 we're going to create and make this the
 default behavior with a couple of in
 changes to the interface so i'm just
 going to demo this by recording on top
 of the lab.busan.com
 slash form fill
 and i'm just going to
 just simply
 demo a very simple form fill
 where where i'm recording it and also
 using the default
 data binding functionality that
 automatically binds it into the
 parameter
 variable okay
 so here we have a simple
 form fill action right and
 as you can see now we've added an icon
 here with a little flash i'm just going
 to start by disabling it and then
 running the test so we see the kind of
 default uh behavior here
 pretty fast but not like super fast
 right
 this is typically what we do is we
 basically execute these actions one by
 one so if i would double click here it's
 kind of this speed of course i can't
 click as fast
 but you see
 how that works so now we're gonna go
 ahead and enable this so what i'm doing
 now is i'm clicking on the flash
 and now you can look at how fast this
 form is filled instead
 so you see that now actually all of the
 fields are sent
 to the application and then executed on
 the application so for really big forms
 this is a huge improvement and we've
 been seeing uh
 uh
 execution times going down to like for
 whole tests
 by 25 30 percent so this is a really a
 strong improvement you might have cases
 where you don't want to have this
 behavior so what i'm going to do here
 i'm just going to pick one action and
 i'm just going to disable it for this
 one so
 under basic info next to switch flag
 we're just going to click non-rapid
 action and this is if you notice a
 specific problem in a form or something
 and we're going to see how this executes
 as you can see the first name was done
 as rapid but because it cannot
 fill the second form in a rapid manner
 it kind of becomes a single action a
 single action and then email and
 password are executed in bulk so it just
 breaks the flow so that's one way of
 doing it
 and then of course you can also take
 if i disable this this is no no
 non-rapid action i can also go to my
 settings and i can disable this
 completely disable out the one action
 execution here
 and if i run this now you're going to
 see that it's back to the normal default
 behavior so we just changed the default
 behavior to not execute a single action
 because we are changing this default
 behavior for your ci runs you should see
 this different and it should be
 hopefully
 much faster executions if you're seeing
 a problem go ahead and disable it or use
 this if you have a specific problem with
 a specific form you can do what i just
 did and you go into basic info
 and uh
 for this thing
 sorry action setting basic info
 non-rapid action and you can disable it
 for a specific field
 but what we're going to see here much
 faster execution times and we're looking
 forward to bringing you even more
 performance improvements in the future
 when we discover these things
 so let us know
 what you think of this and how it's
 working out for you
