Transcript for [Boozang Feature: Flag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gj9yAf6KG-w) by [Merlin](https://merlin.foyer.work/)

 hello
 today i'm just going to show you the
 feature flag in busan
 and flag is something that you use to
 handle conditional situations in busan
 and of course you can use if groups you
 can use the n statement in busan
 you can use loops there's many many
 different ways to handle conditionals
 but flag is one of the more flexible and
 popular ones when it comes to complex
 logic so let me just demonstrate that
 now
 so what i'm going to do here i'm just
 going to call this i'm going to create
 the test called flag demo
 and then i'm just going to record a
 couple of actions here in the lab the
 lab.dusang.com so i'm clicking
 introduction and then overview and i'm
 just going to stop this and try and play
 this back
 so what you see is of course it clicks
 introduction and overview
 just as you would have expected from the
 test
 but of course here if i want to i can
 now add flags to this so i'll add this
 overview and you can see it showing up
 in the
 in the tool right
 and i call this
 intro and then if i want to now
 i can add
 a script action that would
 go to these flags
 so this is very simpler to the switch
 statement in javascript where it will
 jump over a number of actions until it
 finds a match okay
 so here i will use go to flag
 and i will just use here
 intro
 or intro
 now if i run this i'm going to expect
 this to jump to the next action and
 execute normally okay
 okay cool
 so now i'm just going to try and change
 this and change it to overview
 and as you can see it skipped the the
 intro
 uh click right and that means even if i
 would record something inside of this
 which doesn't have a flag it will also
 skip that
 so let's run this and see
 as you can see it just jumps to
 the condition the the flag that it
 matches so remember this can be used as
 a javascript very similar to the switch
 statement so it's very good when you
 have something which could have many
 different outcomes but you want to
 maybe
 choose between
 not just like if else but many different
 outcomes so that's a good example of
 when you want to use this and let me
 just show you here also in the exit
 conditions if you go to condition for an
 action
 depending on the outcome of an action
 in the go to section here you can say
 set
 and here you have go to flag and it will
 allow you to select from the different
 exit conditions as well so you can use
 this using script or exit conditions so
 it's very very flexible
