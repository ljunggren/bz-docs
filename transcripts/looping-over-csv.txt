Transcript for [Boozang Feature: Loop over CSV data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8i8ZykTqd1Y) by [Merlin](https://merlin.foyer.work/)

 let me demonstrate the new csv data
 editor in busan
 often when you have a test case that
 enters a set of data like this filling
 out the form here you can see you can
 fill out first name last name email and
 password and save it to the db
 and it will show up here inside the
 database on the application side let's
 say you have a spreadsheet of data that
 you want to fill
 into this
 database you need to create a loop
 over a set of data so now i'll show you
 how to do that and show the new csv
 editor that we just launched you'll go
 into data here and you create new data
 and instead of object here you choose
 csv
 so i'm going to call this users right
 it's a set of users then it's going to
 ask me do you want to enable loop data
 you don't want to do this but you can go
 ahead and just say yes i want to loop
 this test case over the csv data
 the way you do this here is of course
 now under test setting you have the loop
 data enabled here and it will tell you
 the start and end index which is of
 course zero to the end of the document
 by default
 so
 in data now you can actually start by
 entering the different data so you'll
 start by
 hitting the plus sign and i would
 enter the different things here so let's
 do first name
 and then do plus again to add another
 column
 last name
 and maybe that's enough for us right now
 and then i will say
 mats
 youngren
 and here of course i can use the tab and
 enter keys
 when shang
 lee so now we have a set of data that we
 can loop over okay
 so instead of using parameter first name
 here and parameter last name here
 we can now use
 the loop first name and loop last name
 now remember
 here you need to comply with what's
 exactly in the columns here and you see
 we're using camel case here so let's
 make sure that we modify this
 and as you can see we get autocomplete
 so we get the first name here
 and then on the loop side here we will
 remove this
 and just say
 last name
 so now
 we've created a test case where we've
 hard coded from parameter the email and
 the password and we're now looping over
 this so let's just make sure there is
 nothing in the database and we'll run
 this and it will you it's going to tell
 us do you want to just run this for the
 first entry in the
 csv or the second entry or all of them
 so let's run all of them
 and let's go ahead and press play
 so now we've created a very simple loop
 and as you can see both wenching lee and
 matt youngren is now been saved in the
 application database
