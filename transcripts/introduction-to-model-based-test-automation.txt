Transcript for [Boozang: Introduction to model-based test automation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFcDXUPTrLs) by [Merlin](https://merlin.foyer.work/)

 what if we could automate automation
 what if we could scan your application
 and build the automated test for you
 in end-to-end test automation we spend
 so much time on test creation just to
 get a little bit of feature coverage and
 as our project grows
 your tests are flaky and you push new
 code changes and your tests break
 creating false negatives
 we introduce a new way of doing test
 automation
 where we much like a search engine
 crawler scan your application and build
 a model of it virtually
 then we can auto generate tests for you
 that way you can
 simply when you have code changes rescan
 your application and the test will be
 regenerated for you eliminating a lot of
 the test creation and almost all of the
 test maintenance
 so go and sign up for the beta at

 beta and join us in this exciting new
 way of doing test automation
