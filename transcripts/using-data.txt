Transcript for [Boozang Introduction: Introduction to data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eumv5m0rmOI) by [Merlin](https://merlin.foyer.work/)

 in busan to create reusable tests you
 often need to use data just like in
 regular programming and busan supports
 many different data types the way you
 set data in busan is that when you're
 inside the project navigation you know
 you have selected this topmost icon you
 will access the data tab
 and remember this one is expandable so
 you got to make sure
 that you have it here
 data can be defined on three different
 level test level module level and
 project level
 project level means it's global to the
 project module level means it can be
 shared by the tests and accessed by the
 test in that module and test level the
 data is only for that test and it's
 important that you use proper
 encapsulation so you don't have a bad
 side effects also if you define all data
 as global data it's going to be messy
 so let us try and add data we do that
 with the plus sign here you see now we
 have a set of different data types to
 choose from
 i could go into these in detail but the
 easiest way to play around with them is
 to to learn about these is to play
 around with them and and test them out
 object is json data which has name value
 pairs which is like one level deep so
 that's perfect for a form field like
 this you'll have first name last name
 email and password being stored in a
 single object
 the csv data is used for data similar to
 an excel table when you would have
 several sets of data and that's also a
 loopable data type so for instance if
 you want to enter several users in this
 form you can use csv data
 matrix data is very similar to csv data
 except that you have the first column of
 that data is the primary key so you
 don't usually loop from index 0 to n you
 usually say i want to get the user
 mats and it would fetch my information
 based on that primary key
 the mixed data is to handle complex json
 data
 anything you can have object
 arrays and mixed data here
 and the request data is to fetch data
 from external sources for instance you
 can load data from dropbox or google
 drive
 the js is actually not really a data
 type it's a piece of javascript a
 function that allows you to generate
 dynamic content
 you know we have a content generator
 based on regular expressions but here
 you can write your own functions in
 javascript
 to generate data
 property is for single named value pairs
 so you use that for instance for a
 single field
 file data is to use to either store url
 or to store some binary data the maximum
 here i think is five kilobytes so try to
 keep this data small it's only for test
 purposes
 and then we have the array that allows
 you to generate
 an array of data basically uh you know a
 comma separated array and that's also a
 loopable data type
 so try and play around with this
 and
 let us know if anything is unclear but
 this is something that is very powerful
 in the busan tool and i think the key is
 to get started using data and you can
 get a hang of it pretty fast
