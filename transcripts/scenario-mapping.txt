Transcript for [Boozang Feature: Scenario Mapping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btVAezCaMl8) by [Merlin](https://merlin.foyer.work/)

 let's take a look at the scenario
 mapping feature one thing we found was
 that when you have a lot of scenarios
 sometimes you can get in the hundreds
 it can get a little messy to know
 exactly what you mapped so as you see
 here we have a lot of different given
 conditions here and sometimes
 you want to be able to first of all
 understand what test steps you map to
 which tests
 and without having to kind of click into
 going back and forth
 trying to understand we instead decided
 to allow you to view the full map and
 update tests in bulk so let me
 illustrate that what you want to do is
 you want to go to the roof of the
 project
 and then you want to hit this kebab menu
 here
 and then here you have this review the
 test mapping of scenario
 so what you do here is that you see all
 the terms that you've mapped and
 remember
 one unique string should map to one test
 case but what's good here
 with this new way is that now you can go
 in and see i accept the order is mapped
 to accept current order
 but now of course i can update this like
 this let's say i accept the order test
 and now i have changed all the words to
 be i accept the order test
 to map these so if i close this now
 and search
 i accept the order you see they've all
 been updated in bulk
 another thing that is useful i'm gonna
 of course change this back so first of
 all
 i accept the order i change this
 you can also of course
 uh take the word and see what is it
 mapped to
 and you can of course also
 change what it's mapped to
 we also added uh check boxes here and
 what that allows you to do
 is to for instance if you want to break
 something off
 you can
 unclick a few of them
 and then just update
 the ones you need to update so like that
 so if i do that you see there's two
 different ones now
 so you have i accept the order i accept
 the order test
 so what's useful about that would be for
 instance if you're doing a transition to
 doing like
 maybe you want to do some of this over
 the api you can now break this out and
 do it on a per test basis so let's
 change this back
 but
 all in all
 i'll do yes and you see now we have
 everything under i accept the order so i
 changed it back
 so the purpose here again is when you
 have a lot of different strings mapped
 to different tests
 you can more get a feeling
 for what is mapped where
 and you'll be able to update it more
 easily
