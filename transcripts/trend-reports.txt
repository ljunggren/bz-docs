Transcript for [Boozang Feature: Trend Reports](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P77WuCKTXiA) by [Merlin](https://merlin.foyer.work/)

 in this release we also wanted to
 improve reporting
 and even though we haven't finalized our
 big
 management ui upgrade that is happening
 later on this year
 we decided that
 why not update the reports inside the
 tool
 so what we are now very very happy to
 announce
 is trend reports imagine you're running
 tests over a long period of time and you
 know especially in jenkins and with
 cucumber report it's hard to get an
 understanding what's happening over time
 with your tests
 now we've introduced a new tab here
 called trend reports so if you click
 into trend reports and let's say you
 select i'm just going to select my main
 suite that is all the regression tests
 for this project
 now we can actually get a view of
 how
 the tests have changed over time you see
 here we have a spike of failures
 and you can also see how the performance
 was changing over time so you can see
 performance trends and then of course
 you can scroll down
 and drill into particular tests for
 instance i see my ad campaign test being
 problematic i click into this and then i
 get the view of
 when was it failing
 here right so now i'm getting a much
 better way to do some data mining
 with my tests and remember
 the actual filter now is in the url so
 now you can actually bookmark this and
 share this with other team members to
 point out certain trends another thing
 that is cool is that you can also
 download the report
 so you could use that when
 you know sharing it or putting it into
 an email or something like that so super
 excited about this i think you will find
 it useful so let us know if there is
 anything that can be improved or is
 unclear
