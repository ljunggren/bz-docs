Transcript for [Boozang Feature: Adaptive screen sizes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXFt52AvwUs) by [Merlin](https://merlin.foyer.work/)

 before we had some issues
 with lining up the
 ide Boozang window and the application
 window side by side
 and we were trying to be too smart
 now instead we have allowed you to
 easily specify
 what
 window size of the application that you
 want
 you can do the adapter window size which
 is of course what we were doing before
 where we adapt the application window
 but then you can now also of course set
 to use 100 of the screen size
 or
 simply
 take a set resolution usually on the
 with
 or
 one of the predetermined devices like an
 iphone
 and of course if you need to add
 devices to your list you'll go into more
 options and you can simply
 unselect what's not interesting for you
 and add any devices that you might need
 like this
 so now of course i have my galaxy for
 instance
 so i think this is going to improve a
 lot for you to experiment with different
 screen sizes and emulate a lot of the
 kind of simple
 device testing
 for the web in the web browser that you
 need to do so i think this is a good
 step for us to just improve the way that
 you can adapt for different screen sizes
 and do simple mobile testing so let us
 know what you think about this
 functionality i think it's a pretty good
 improvement that we have in order to do
 simple quick
 tests on top on different screen sizes
