Transcript for [Boozang Feature: Coded tests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnAPWQPtP3Y) by [Merlin](https://merlin.foyer.work/)

 now i'm going to talk about coded tests
 in Boozang and
 what we've seen here i have a very
 simple
 straightforward test that i actually
 recorded and now there is a new coded
 view in Boozang
 where if you switch over you get the
 actual code for the test and as you can
 see because the selectors are so simple
 you see that it simply is
 script set first name script set and a
 number of set actions followed by two
 click actions and this is where you can
 do like a lot now in code so you can
 choose if you want to work in code or if
 you want to work more with the recorder
 replay standard approach
 and
 we think that in certain cases it's best
 to work in code in other cases better to
 record your journey so from what i
 usually do is i start by making the test
 using the record function
 and then maybe i'll edit or fix it using
 the code function but you can play
 around with that
 another very good thing is of course we
 have a very powerful tool a lot of
 features are hidden
 but here of course when i write script i
 get out to complete so that way i can
 also explore what functionality we have
 in the tool
 using code
 another really cool thing is of course
 if you are
 and copying this test
 of course i can basically just take the
 code
 take and create a new test let's say
 fill the form
 and here it's
 form fill
 and now if i just paste this back here
 and i can also make modifications let's
 say i'll
 i'll just copy this now i can go back
 into action view and the test is
 automatically updated so now you can go
 back and forth between code
 and
 recording action view and that way you
 can also learn the code language very
 easily by just recording a test and then
 switching over
 so let us know what you think about this
 new functionality
