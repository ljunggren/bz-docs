Transcript for [Boozang Feature: Javascript action and util function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MTd0qLAudU) by [Merlin](https://merlin.foyer.work/)

 i will now demo uh how you add
 javascript uh and how you run javascript
 actions
 and of course this is something that
 we've been doing from the beginning with
 busan for several years now but i think
 it would require i just want to show
 with you till function that we added and
 demonstrate the difference so
 let's say i want to
 run some javascript on this application
 page right
 here i have some simple jquery
 javascript saying
 you know add this uh a piece of
 html into the dom tree on the document
 body using a pen too
 so if i run this of course what you can
 see here is that it appended this little
 demo into the application so what i want
 to remind you to do is of course here
 you play it on app right not on ide
 so ide would be you want to run some
 javascript in this window
 and app would be you run it in your
 application window so that's the
 standard thing you want to do
 and we can simply demonstrate this i'll
 use location href i set the url of
 course if i go and play this on the app
 it will go to google and of course if i
 would do it on ide i'm totally gonna
 mess this up now because i'm gonna send
 myself to google
 so
 well what you can see here is if i open
 this and i run a piece of javascript
 here of course it's not going to be
 persistent in a reload
 so we were fighting a really difficult
 problem with a payment system that was
 running a piece of the javascript that
 would kind of oh yeah you're trying to
 automate me oh i don't like this so it
 was kind of failing out so what we did
 was we added
 a bit of persistent javascript that uses
 the extension to inject javascript so
 this is you know a little bit risky you
 got to know what you're doing but i want
 to tell you that this exists
 so what we do is you you'll use util
 extend
 it says exception script here that's a
 typo but don't mind that for now it's
 going to be extend extension script so
 you're going to use extend extension
 script okay and i defined a bit of a
 code here so if i run this
 what it's going to do is it's the next
 time you reload your page it's always
 going to inject this data and i can
 reload this as much as i want so you can
 use this to kind of create a little bit
 of a adapter or javascript hook that
 always is present in your application
 page you can use this to intercept
 functions doing overrides pretty
 powerful stuff so i
 encourage you to check it out but now as
 you can see it's stuck what do i do well
 simply run extend again extension script
 with no arguments
 and next reload it will be removed so
 you know reach out to us if you want to
 know more about this function and how it
 works but just be aware that there is
 something you can use here and it can be
 very very powerful for certain hairy
 situations where you have maybe an
 off-the-shelf application that doesn't
 do what you want it to do
 or is resistant to automation then we
 can trick it a little bit using this
 function
