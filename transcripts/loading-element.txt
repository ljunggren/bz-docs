Transcript for [Boozang Feature: Loading Element](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofUZX1QxOeA) by [Merlin](https://merlin.foyer.work/)

 let me demonstrate this loading element
 sometimes you have in your application a
 spinner or something that shows you that
 the application is not ready that it's
 loading then it's good to automatically
 have the test to globally wait for this
 it could be a spinner or something like
 that and you know it's not going to
 continue the test execution so you don't
 have to set those individual timeouts to
 increase those in many places it's just
 a global setting
 but sometimes as you can see in this
 application the load is very quick and
 it's hard to capture so i'm just going
 to show you a trick on how you capture
 this okay and this is a little hard so
 you're going to have to try a few times
 to figure this out so you go to sources
 in the google chrome console you hit
 reload and then you try to be lightning
 fast you hit that pause button right and
 now i wasn't fast enough so i'll do it
 again see if i can
 you see now you pause the application so
 you see the spinner now you can actually
 go back
 to the element and capture this one so
 let me try capture this one i'll use the
 selector and i'll hit this loading here
 so the way i'll do it this this is a
 little tricky
 so let's see if i can do it
 there
 nope
 okay maybe i can capture that
 and then try capture this loading here
 very tricky
 okay i'll capture the image for now
 and then
 you see here there's the h5
 the
 typography root so you want to try and
 capture this element so what i'll do is
 i'll just i'll just copy this for now
 and then i'll paste it into a loading
 element and the way i'll do it instead
 is
 i'll take one of these
 maybe the display block
 and i'll just add here
 i'll add the dot
 because it's a class right
 and then i'll just add our selector for
 it and what i'll use here is contains
 loading
 and now when you set this the
 id the test execution will automatically
 wait
 for this
 to disappear until running the next
 actions so this is a global setting to
 make sure your tests are more stable in
 case your application is slow to answer
