Transcript for [Upstream test navigator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQt20L39EME) by [Merlin](https://merlin.foyer.work/)

 let me show you the Upstream test
 Navigator we've had the ability to view
 Upstream tests for quite a while but we
 realized that it would be nice to have a
 navigator function for this to make it a
 little clearer so remember usually
 you'll have your cucumber tests right
 here referencing a bunch of tests in
 your um that you've recorded or created
 in some way and sometimes it's easy that
 it gets a little messy let's say here I
 have the test ad product or I wonder
 where this test step is being used so
 what you used to do is you would be able
 to navigate up in the tree hitting this
 show Upstream tests and that would just
 navigate up in the tree but instead now
 we kind of created this Navigator which
 shows you all your Upstream tests so I
 can now see that my ADD product is used
 in create product add other product etc
 etc and also where it's used by by a
 test that is being referenced you can
 now see the full tree so I think this is
 very helpful before you would have to
 navigate several steps and let's say you
 have a test that reference a test that
 reference a test it can get complicated
 but here you would see it as a tree and
 you can expand and you can see exactly
 how your test step is used so this is
 really useful for navigation but also
 useful if you want to refactor your code
 us say I'm going to change this test
 what am I going to affect and which
 cucumber scenarios is going to be
 affected by this so I think this is a a
 nice modification and also here if you
 use the icon you can easily just
 navigate to the test let's say I'm on
 another test and I go here I can easily
 navigate to the test by clicking this
 test case icon and as you can see I can
 do many and I can switch between them
 and when I no longer need to check them
 I will just close them here so it's more
 of a navigator concept for your test
 case references your plug test case so I
 hope this will be helpful for you
 especially when you have a bit of a
 bigger project
