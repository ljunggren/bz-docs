Transcript for [Boozang: Introduction to modelling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzocfoIlyS4) by [Merlin](https://merlin.foyer.work/)

 in Boozang we are super excited to
 announce
 a concept where we scan your application
 to build test coverage
 let me show you how that works
 we introduce a new concept called the ai
 module
 in the ai module we will build a virtual
 representation of your application
 initially you get prompted what
 operations do you want to have for your
 module
 the module should be what you have in
 your data model for your application
 in this case it's a project management
 application so i'll say project
 now it will build a structure that is
 the outline of your application and now
 you need to start linking them together
 making sure you identify
 the elements in your application
 now this is complete but your work is
 just getting started start by
 identifying the different critical
 elements in your application
 here as you can see
 it has guessed that my button should be
 create project but let me update that
 as we call it create
 new project
 now i can try clicking on the element
 and as you can see it works
 now
 all the application forms in order to
 build tests instead of doing record and
 replay
 you can automatically scan
 all the forms to build tests for it
 what's really interesting is of course
 that all the dependencies inside the
 forms are captured
 now when you've done this for your
 application for all your different
 modules you can go into the data flow
 and start building end-to-end tests
 now with these data-driven test steps
 you can build test coverage really fast
 and maintenance is almost completely
