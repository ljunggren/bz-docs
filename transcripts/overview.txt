Transcript for [Boozang Introduction: Overview of the tool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04dgNzouE1w) by [Merlin](https://merlin.foyer.work/)

 now i'm gonna go over the different
 parts of the tool
 and maybe give a few tips
 on what to think about when you're doing
 test automation
 when you're in Boozang you see you have
 this big sidebar with many different
 things to choose from well
 normally when you're creating tests you
 want to make sure that you've selected
 this topmost icon that's basically the
 navigation tree the creation view where
 you create test and playback test okay
 so
 if you
 look here on the right hand side you
 will see your list of modules
 and on the right hand side you see the
 sidebar with
 you can choose between different views
 for instance if you want the card
 presentation you can press here but you
 can also have a graphical presentation
 of your testing tree
 normally you will use this top one
 as you can see there is also
 tabs here between modules and features
 well
 this is one thing that can be a little
 bit confusing at first in Boozang
 inside modules you will have your test
 automation code your tests basically
 your test scripts
 under features you will have your
 cucumber code your business logic
 basically
 scenarios and features that
 use the syntax given when then
 if you're not using cucumber testing you
 can completely ignore this feature
 section but we do recommend you using
 give and when then so you will be in the
 business domain here creating the
 features
 or you know
 having the features here being
 synchronized from an external system and
 then you'll tie it to test automation
 code
 in the module sections
 inside
 any module you will see that
 you will have a list of tests
 and if you go
 of course first you'll see you'll have
 different test types here you have tests
 api tests
 scenarios which you don't usually use
 it's a special ai case that you won't
 usually use but it allows you to put
 crud test for given when done inside
 your modules
 you have your suite which is your test
 suite that is used to drive tests and
 you have sub modules to be able to break
 down your application into smaller
 modules
 inside the existing modules
 inside any test
 you will find the test steps which are
 the
 actions here
 so if you want to execute a single
 action you can simply double click it
 you will also find
 a sidebar with a number of functions
 and a number of sub tabs that
 number of tabs that has
 different
 ways
 to troubleshoot and to set data for your
 test and also different sub
 tabs that will describe the details of a
 single action
 so again you'll have a data tab that has
 the test data you'll have a console tab
 that will help you troubleshoot
 you will have the test setting tab that
 has the title of your test and also
 parameters and you'll have the action
 setting that is the detailed setting for
 each and every action
 and inside the action setting you will
 have three sub-tabs the main tab that
 has the element and the values being set
 the
 condition tab that allows you to
 customize the outcome of an action and
 also a more advanced scripting tab that
 allows you to
 apply specific javascript or individual
 loops on a specific action
 so that's a general overview of the tool
 there's also of course much more actions
 in the sidebar and things you can do
 settings
 ci server reports etc but we're not
 going to go into that right now in order
 to get started
 simply create the module create a test
 and start recording actions
