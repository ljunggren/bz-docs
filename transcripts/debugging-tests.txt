Transcript for [Boozang Introduction: Debugging a test-case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQx-a1KWkaA) by [Merlin](https://merlin.foyer.work/)

 there are many ways to debug tests in
 Boozang so let me show you a couple of
 them
 here we have a simple test that fills
 out a form in Boozang
 and now of course if you want to debug
 this the way you want to do this is
 probably by double clicking a single
 action you can execute it and make sure
 that
 what's happening is what you expect here
 it fills out the first name and here
 i'll double click and it fills out the
 last name
 if you want to debug this with a
 specific
 set of data that is not something you've
 defined in parameter you can override
 that on a single action using debug
 action so let's open this and let's try
 another test value here we'll say test
 value here and i'll hit the play button
 and now you see now you've debugged this
 with some custom value and this is
 especially good to do with validations
 there are also other ways to debug the
 test if you're playing it you want to
 stop at a certain point you can set a
 break point so let me demonstrate that
 this will play the test
 until the break point
 and as you see it's now stopped at the
 break point so what do we do here
 there's a few things we can do we can go
 into the
 console and let's delete this and delete
 the filter
 in the console we can now type
 parameter
 and we will get the current value
 when this test is being executed at this
 specific point and then if we want to
 continue the execution we can simply
 press play
 there is also a way to go back and see
 what data we had at a certain point
 if you look at this um
 console window you will see the log from
 the test execution and what you've
 logged but you can also see a snapshot
 in time what the data was here
 in the drop down on the data snapshot
 there's also some more advanced
 debugging capabilities that you can use
 so let's remove this breakpoint by
 clicking it again and let's go into the
 action settings here
 you see now i've added the script
 function and now i want to log a
 particular value so i added these
 brackets dash dash dash you don't have
 to do that but i'll show you why that
 can be useful and i'm simply putting
 javascript in here where i'm debugging
 the
 particular value of email here so let's
 play this again
 and as you can see
 now
 uh you can go into the console window
 and now you remember i put dash dash
 dash and you can see now i am testing
 with email aa bb.com
 and then the most powerful way to debug
 which you don't usually need to use but
 which can be very very powerful is that
 you can add a breakpoint inside the
 script and then you can use the
 debugging capability
 of
 the
 of the browser of the chrome browser
 right so what i'm going to do now is
 i'll keep the
 inspect open the chrome development
 console open and i play the test case
 back
 and now you can see the
 the actual
 log happening in the chrome console
 but of course you can also now see you
 see you have the debugger here and now
 you can hover over the variables
 see what value a variable have and you
 can also use the step over function or
 resume in the chrome console and this is
 of course very very powerful for
 debugging purposes so again
 many ways to debug your test case in
 Boozang especially with a powerful chrome
 console
