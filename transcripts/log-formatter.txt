Transcript for [Boozang Feature: Log formatter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYi0thrp8Fc) by [Merlin](https://merlin.foyer.work/)

 we've just introduced the log formatter
 in Boozang and it's an addition to the
 extension so make sure you're running
 the latest extension
 when we're recording this video that's
 380.
 this modification will greatly improve
 your troubleshooting capabilities as you
 know we log a lot of things in Boozang so
 when running it for instance from a ci
 server sometimes it's hard to find the
 root cause maybe you have a problem that
 is only appearing when you're running it
 in jenkins and maybe not when you're
 running it in the ide
 and i'm going to show you what kind of
 game changer this is let's say you have
 a long complex log like this
 uh which is what we
 have it's definitely possible using the
 search to troubleshoot it but in the
 extension now we have a log formatter
 that will greatly improve that so let me
 demonstrate
 first of all talk a little bit about the
 configuration you can automatically
 activate this
 by telling
 basically which is the url you should
 activate the log formatter for here i've
 set it to match this url in jenkins and
 also
 you can
 a very slightly complex functionality
 but when you have several workers that i
 have you can actually uh
 kind of merge these logs together and
 get all the information for all the jobs
 so we're super excited about this
 we have also have a couple of
 performance thresholds that can help you
 troubleshoot slow tests and slow
 dispatching but i'm not going to go into
 detail about that so let's go ahead and
 hit format current page so what this
 does is it automatically looks at the
 log and renders this much more friendly
 view that you see right now so this is
 going to be a game changer for
 troubleshooting so let me demonstrate
 what we see
 first of all we have a number of some
 information around what's the root test
 case what's the
 docker runner version and what's your
 ide version and the extension version
 this is helpful but also helpful for us
 if you happen to post these logs for us
 we will know exactly what version you
 are running
 in here instead of giving you this
 unfriendly log you can now see
 all the different tests that were run in
 this case it's cucumber and you can open
 up
 and drill into any
 individual actions like this with the
 accordions
 what i really like here
 is when you just in the overview you can
 also
 see directly what is green was
 successful and what was read was
 failures and you can very easily see the
 failure screenshot by clicking on the
 camera here where i can see the problem
 not only that uh one thing that is
 really good is that we've added a number
 of sorting functions here where you can
 sort by completion time which is the
 normal one what
 completed first second etc
 but then of course what i really like
 you can sort by result to get all the
 failures on top
 you can sort by performance which i like
 to do to find my slow tests to see if
 there's something i can do to improve
 performance and you can also sort by
 worker to get them in order
 which worker executed what tests and
 also to get an understanding if the
 tests were kind of shared equally
 between the workers or if one worker got
 stuck
 so there's a lot to explore here i
 encourage you to check it out
 there will be a separate video around
 the root cause analysis here
 that i will talk about because i find
 that this is a topic on its own but
 there's going to be a lot of
 improvements being done in this view and
 there's going to be a lot to talk about
 so
 i encourage you to check it out
 and reach out to us if you can't get it
 to work
