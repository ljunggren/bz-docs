Transcript for [Boozang Feature: Screenshots & Evidences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAZjlsj7908) by [Merlin](https://merlin.foyer.work/)

 being able to know what's wrong and to
 troubleshoot your test as one of the
 most important things of course
 so one of the things that we do is of
 course when you have a test failing we
 will give you
 the piece of log
 and the steps that led up to that
 problem but usually it can be very
 helpful to have a screenshot so i'm just
 going to show you how we support the
 error screenshots that we add by default
 but also how we support reference
 screenshots and additional evidence
 so in order to do that i've created a
 very simple test in Boozang
 and it's a cucumber test
 and it's simple it has a step a given i
 am logged in it logs you in
 and then it says i make a screenshot but
 what we're actually doing here i'm going
 to show you is we're going to make three
 different screenshots and then this one
 is just a dummy step
 so and i make a screenshot i have one
 a new javascript function util attach
 screenshot to report so remember to keep
 the brackets for that
 this function takes the element path
 that you can put inside of here if you
 want to take a screenshot of a specific
 element
 otherwise leave it blank and it will
 take the whole application window
 so this will generate the screenshot but
 then
 in this path which is of course if i run
 this test
 and i run this action it's actually
 going to fail so i set this up to fail
 automatically
 and what i've also done is i've used
 this button here which is a screenshot
 button to take
 a picture of the element so that would
 be a reference for this one for this
 particular action you have a screenshot
 reference
 and then
 if we look in
 uh of course if you look at any cucumber
 plugin in the cucumber report you would
 actually see these three screenshots you
 would see the evidence screenshot
 you would see
 the failing screenshot what the
 what
 sees
 when it's failing this validation but
 you will also put this reference
 screenshot next to it so let me show you
 if we go into um
 the
 x-ray here we're of course integrating
 with x-ray
 and i go i created a dashboard here with
 my tests and i look at the latest test
 failure or execution failure
 in x-ray of course you will see
 everything lined up and then you can
 drill down into the individual test
 executions and if i want to take a look
 here i will go into
 the step where i see of course what's
 wrong with this step
 i see the problem is i can't find this
 new company
 and the validation for that failed but
 then i can also get more information
 from the evidence log
 and of course here we've overdone it a
 little bit
 i first added a reference screenshot
 which you can also do
 on successful steps and you can see it
 has a blue shade to it
 and then we have what we were seeing
 when it was failing basically it was
 seeing the wrong page the validation
 failed so it made a full screenshot of
 the page and then we can also see the
 original element it was looking for so
 don't you don't usually use these in
 tandem but i've just shown you how you
 can add
 evidence screenshots into a test step
 and also how you can add a reference
 test step to a failed validation
 so play around with this and
 i think you will find it very helpful
 and remember screenshots if you take it
 with the whole screen takes a bit of
 space so don't overuse these functions
