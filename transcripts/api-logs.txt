Transcript for [Boozang Feature: API logs (JSON tree view)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNjjG7SeGbY) by [Merlin](https://merlin.foyer.work/)

 now i want to talk about a new feature
 or more of an ux update that we did to
 just really simplify
 um
 the presentation of
 json data especially for troubleshooting
 api request
 so let's see here let me open one of
 these and do an api request to create a
 product
 what we've done now is in the result
 here you see that you have these very
 easy to navigate here is the request
 this is the data that's going out
 you can see the company and you can see
 the response and you can open and close
 this json structure
 so one of the tricks here
 that are really useful is that you can
 double click the request and it will
 open up the whole tree
 so it's really nice when you want to
 expand the whole tree and you can do
 this on on any level of course
 so this is a small thing as you can see
 it's very useful when you have a lot of
 request and response for instance
 when i'm looking at temporary database
 sometimes i have
 many of these requests and response and
 it's pretty good to be able to open this
 up and for instance
 just open up the whole response to
 troubleshoot what's going on and as you
 can see we also have the syntax
 highlighting here to make it easy to
 troubleshoot and find any problems
