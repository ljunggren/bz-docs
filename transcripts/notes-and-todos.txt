Transcript for [Boozang Feature: Notes and Todos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YmBce5D9nGM) by [Merlin](https://merlin.foyer.work/)

 the next feature i'm going to show you
 now is the way to
 leave little notes in Boozang
 uh
 there's a few different ways to do this
 and the key is as your project grows and
 you work in a team it's good to be able
 to mark a test for instance there is
 still yet to be work to be done here or
 the classical thing that you usually do
 in programming which is to do
 so let me show you this so first of all
 if i create a new test let's say i'm
 going to call this note
 demo
 i'm creating a test and i'm just going
 to go ahead and record a couple of
 actions here so let's say
 i'm clicking introduction overview speed
 gain weight game yellow or blue cat or
 dog and again this site i'm using to
 demo this is the lab.Boozang.com
 you might have seen that before
 so i'm just going to go ahead and stop
 this and play this back nothing strange
 it goes over all the different links
 right
 now let's say we know that a speedy game
 here is going to change
 its name okay
 and we want to make a note here remember
 this what i do is i'm going to go here
 i'm going to go down into the action
 panel here and i'm going to click on the
 note
 and i'm just going to add something
 this will
 change
 name
 to
 um
 let's call this this will be
 the
 the
 speed
 speeding game okay
 and as you can see
 i have now marked this as a note so now
 when i'm you know out navigating and i'm
 coming back
 into the test here to note demo i can
 directly see that there's something to
 be done here or something to take note
 of what i can also do is i can also do
 it something a little bit stronger i'll
 click on this note and i say
 this is urgent
 to be fixed and what i'm doing i'm
 hitting the little to-do and now it
 gives me a little to-do batch
 for me to see very easily so these are a
 few ways you can you know when you're
 doing test and testing progress how you
 can lead to those and notes
 in your test and also remember if you
 want to you can also leave a note on the
 global test and the way you do it you'll
 pick here and you say this test is
 unfinished and then it will also were
 finished
 and then it will also leave a global
 note on the test and as you can see as i
 hover over this you can see that this
 test is unfinished
 and on the note uh you see
 you can also read it from the title tag
 so there's a few ways on how you can
 leave notes
 to other team members and also to
 yourself
