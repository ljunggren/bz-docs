now I want to talk about canvas testingor more precisely test automation on topof the HTML canvas element this kind oftesting is incredibly challengingbecause there's no way to look insidethe canvas element so how can you dotest automation on top of it this couldbe for instance JRA or Canan boards orthings like this could be using a canvaselement and having drag and drop ofcards and things inside of it so alwaysvery challenging to do test automationon top of this what you usually do usingthe most test automation tools is youyou would use an XY coordinate to createa drag drop event to another XYcoordinate but these tests are of courseknown to be really really flaky and assoon as the windows change or thedimensions change these tests will breakso I'm going to show you an alternativeway to do this withif you go to the lab we have somethingcalled the canvas game and you can lookhere there's no cheating what you cansee here is of course it's a canvaselement and the game is we want toautomate dragging this ball into the boxand we get successokay the problem is what we want toemulate is that we can reset theposition of this ball so of course wecannot use oh just go from the this xcoordinate to this ycoordinate now let me show how this willbe done in Boozang with the new canvastestingfeature I hit record I hit the resetbutton and I try to dve the ball intothebox as you can see it creates a dragdrop event ball to box where it reads inthe canvas the name ball and box and nowlet'ssee as you can see it manages to dragthe ball to the box and you can also dothe validations the same way sobasically by using the text of theelements inside the canvas you now havevery stable selectors and let meillustrate I'm going to hit this resetmany times now the ball is in a verydifficult position and see that it doesit every time so here with this way youcan now do test automation on top ofyour canvas without the flakiness
