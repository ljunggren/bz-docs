as you have noticed we've taken manycues from visual studio codeand in order to work on a verycomplicated test projectimagine you have a lot of scenarios ormaybe just a lot of modules and tests werealized the navigation was difficult sowe created the tree navigationand then we realized we weren't reallyutilizing the tabs properly so now we'vetaken the cue from visual studio codeand create the dynamic versus statictabsif you are familiar with visual studiocode you might know this functionalityif you are using it but let medemonstrate it very quicklyin let's say i close a tab and i have atab open as you can see this is now initalics so that allows me to browsearound in my test and as you can seethe tabisyou know being changed it's changing thecurrent tabif i want this tab to stay i'll simplydouble click on it and it now becomespinnedand now when i browse over the differenttests it opens a new tabthat also means of course that if i goback to my static tab that's now beenpinned if i double click it and now ibrowse it will change that tab againanother change we did well let me alsonote that just like visual studio codeyou can double click on the tab toswitch between the pin tab which makesit stayand the italic tab that makes it changeand then alsoif you go and you go to settings forinstance that will always open a new tabso even if you have a tab it shouldnaturally change that oneanother change we did is the fact thatbefore when you were working onsomething we would kind of change whereyou were when you press play and we'vekind of changed the run mode and nowwhen you press play we just open up anew play tabwhich allows you when you close it to gostraight back to where you were so wethink this is a big improvement forusability but we're also trying toreally get this right so if you havesome feedback on how we can improve thiseven more we would love to hear it
