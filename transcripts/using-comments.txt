Transcript for [Boozang Feature: Using Comments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywuO4zPk3lk) by [Merlin](https://merlin.foyer.work/)

 now i'm going to demonstrate the feature
 the comment function in Boozang
 uh this is something we have had live
 for a long time and then it stopped
 working for a little bit and now we
 fixed it and reintroduced it okay
 so
 i'm gonna go ahead and create a new test
 here and i'm gonna you use the
 lava.Boozang.com as usual and what i'm
 gonna do is now i'm just gonna say
 annotate
 bugs okay
 we call it comment but some people call
 it annotations it's basically the same
 thing
 and we're going to use the page visual
 bugs and if you click on it here you can
 find this at the lab dot Boozang dot com
 slash visual bugs okay
 the comment function is used to just
 annotate bugs in the user interface and
 it's kind of where
 manual testing meets
 automated testing you can still use
 for as you know an automated machine
 system is not good at
 detecting some visual bugs like styling
 bags so what we're going to do is we're
 just going to show how you can point
 that out and basically use that link
 in a you know like in the bug report
 you'll get
 um instead of having like steps to
 reproduce you'll have an executable test
 that shows you the problem so what i'm
 going to do here is i'm going to go
 ahead and record and i'm going to use
 this next link so here i see that the
 image is a zebra and i see the label
 zebra
 and i see the image is a sheta and the
 images the label is sheeta so that seems
 good
 also lion seems all right and then here
 of course i come to a problem with a
 mislabeled image of course this could be
 this does not comply to style guide etc
 etc so i'll just show you how you would
 do this here instead of doing the
 validation i would just use the comment
 and i would maybe highlight here the
 label and say
 and i will write here in the description
 fields
 this should be and i think this is a
 mere cat
 maybe meerkat is with a k actually
 anyways
 and i will go ahead and just click next
 and of course here says meerkats and
 this should be
 giraffe right so i'll do the same thing
 here
 this should
 be
 giraffe
 okay that's good so what i'm going to go
 ahead and do now is just run the test so
 you can see how it looks
 and if i run it now
 you're going to see the annotation in
 the ui so you could use this to just
 point out the problems and you can go
 through a list of tests
 and here you see again this should be
 giraffe and you can just step through
 the test so it's a good way to use
 automated testing
 to
 maybe help you when you need to kind of
 show
 problems in the application so that's
 something we do a little note of course
 this thing becomes now this is just a
 link so you could share this in your bug
 report and then you have an executable
 you can just click on this and just have
 the people play this directly in our
 tool
 another note we should do here is of
 course we also have this
 show selection for pass fail
 and if i do hit this in both these cases
 and i play the test you're going to see
 that
 you also get a way for the user to to
 say
 okay now i didn't reload this page
 properly so again i'm just gonna
 hit that visual bugs here and then run
 the test again so it's on the right link
 okay
 and of course now you could create
 a test sequence where you say
 uh verify that this complies to the
 style guide and i can for instance do
 pass here i can click pass
 and then i can of also kind of mark this
 as fail and if i do that of course i
 will have an error and i could see that
 also in the report what failed and what
 worked so this is something you can
 experiment with
 this is what we call hybrid testing
 using automated test
 tools to do
 manual testing
