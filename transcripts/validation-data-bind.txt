Transcript for [Boozang Feature: Validation data-bind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FMtt6EViyA) by [Merlin](https://merlin.foyer.work/)

 okay let me demo the validation data
 bind feature
 this should be a pretty short demo
 um as you know when we record a form
 fill or any sort of data entry in busan
 we by default
 data bind it to the parameter space so
 you can send parameters to test and of
 course change
 the test data to improve usability
 so
 in this case i'm also going to show how
 we do this for validations okay
 so what i'm going to do is i'm going to
 use the lab so that's the lab.busan.com
 and i'm going to go ahead and just uh
 create the test that is called add
 validate
 to do
 and
 if you want to open up the lab here you
 can see that this one is under sorted
 list okay
 so what we're gonna do here i'm gonna go
 to the url sorted list and as you can
 see you just click on the link and you
 see that the page is being reloaded so
 we're on the right page
 let's say we have no
 to do items and i'll just go ahead and
 record here
 and i'll add an item called for instance
 feed the cat okay
 and i'm going to use the tab here to
 make sure that this is
 recorded individually and then i click
 add to do
 that's good because now we will have a
 separate set action and a separate click
 action that's what we want to have here
 and as you see here we also have this
 validation here so i'm just going to go
 ahead and validate that feed the cat was
 added so i'm just going to click on the
 validation and unfeed the cat
 what's cool here is of course that as
 you can see is the add new to do
 data bounded into dollar parameter add
 new to do and the validation
 automatically uses dollar parameter ad
 to do
 so if i go ahead delete this and run
 this test
 it should execute successfully
 and that's not so strange it would do it
 otherwise as well but now of course i
 have a fully reusable test so here
 instead of feed the cat i can add feed
 the dog under test setting
 uh parameter
 so i set feed the dog instead and i'll
 run this
 and as you can see
 it also passes so it means that both the
 add action
 and the validation action is data bind
 bonded
 bounded into data
 of course you could do this manually by
 using inserting here the dollar double
 bracket and parameter and the variable
 name but it's kind of nice to have this
 done automatically for you so you can
 save you some time
