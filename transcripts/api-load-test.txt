Transcript for [Boozang Feature: API load test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vzp5W-AoVJM) by [Merlin](https://merlin.foyer.work/)

 one additional feature that we recently
 changed in busan is the api loading test
 so we supported this before but right
 now we've changed it so it's a new
 action type so the way it works is that
 you will create
 a new test and what we do here
 is that
 i don't know if you looked at the video
 previously but we have now for instance
 a post
 a get and a delete and these are done uh
 against by recording
 this
 ui right so
 in the lab we have this
 form fill functionality that post data
 to an api
 so what we've done now we have a post we
 also have a get when you do show users
 in db
 and we also have a delete so that's what
 you're seeing so what we're going to do
 is we're going to create a new api test
 and we're just going to call this load
 test
 and then we're going to choose the api
 host
 and what you want to do is
 what we support
 is the fact that
 let's go back there
 what we support here is that you can now
 use existing api actions
 that you've either recorded
 or created in your load test so let's
 start by that
 so what we're doing here i'm doing
 new and i do load test here
 and when i do that as you see we have a
 list of api tests and what we allow you
 to do is not just doing like a thousand
 post requests or a thousand
 uh get requests it's you can do like a
 group of things so what we're gonna do
 is we're gonna post some data then we're
 gonna try and load the data and then
 we're going to delete it afterwards
 which is usually a pretty good group
 because you won't get tons of data build
 up so we're going to try that now so i'm
 going to use the plus and it's still
 going to find this i'm going to do first
 i'm going to select from the form the
 post request
 and then i'm going to add again i'm
 going to do the get request
 and then again i'm going to make sure we
 have the delete
 and then what you want to do is of
 course you want to make sure that when
 you post
 you want to make sure that the variable
 for the id is carried over
 and actually here
 we're lucky normally you needed to do
 some manual work here but what you
 basically want to do is you want to make
 sure that what's being returned from one
 of the scripts
 is being set when you try to retrieve
 the entry which is actually correct here
 you see how it says parameter id here
 right
 and then you want to make sure that
 that's also carried forward to the
 delete function so we will open the
 delete function
 and as you see there is also the id
 function there right
 so so now of course
 here you would normally need to do
 a little bit of work but we're just
 going to try and see how this works and
 we're not going to do something crazy
 we'll use
 30 we use 30 seconds 10 users and a ramp
 up time of 10 seconds okay and we'll
 play this
 to see what we have in the end and in
 the meantime you can actually kind of
 play around with this and see what's
 happening well it looks like
 a bunch of things are being created
 let's hope they're being deleted as well
 so maybe there was a mistake i did but
 we'll see very soon
 if that's the case we will see as soon
 as this completes
 uh if it's managed to kind of clean up
 the users because what's happening now
 is you'll have a lot of concurrent users
 doing the
 requests and then in the end we're
 hoping as you can see it cleaned up
 afterwards so now what you want to do is
 you want to hit this report icon
 and now you can see here you can see
 okay
 we have the load test being executed
 that's great but that's not what we want
 to do you want to look at this ramp up
 report because we did a ramp up load
 test
 and what you can see here is
 as we ramp up and as the requests are
 hanging the request time goes up a
 little bit
 hitting almost here around 1.5 seconds
 but as you can see it managed to process
 over 3 000 requests in 30 seconds so at
 least that's uh
 about 100 requests per second which is
 about what you would expect so this is
 the kind of simple api test you can do
 you can simply group for instance a
 creation api request a deletion
 and you can play around with this and of
 course
 specify how you carry forward
 the data
