Transcript for [Boozang Feature: Recording a test and customizing it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-h1296ydoM) by [Merlin](https://merlin.foyer.work/)

 hello
 today i'm just going to redo a simple
 recording using the busang tool let me
 show you how you can customize the
 different actions as we've changed the
 user interface a little bit
 uh hopefully for the better
 so bear with me what we're using today
 is we're using the lab.busan.com and
 again i'm going to use form fill as i
 usually do
 and what i'm doing is i'm hitting this
 address bar and it will bring up the
 application and i'm going to start with
 doing a simple recording so i'm going to
 hit the record here
 and then i'm going to fill here and
 remember
 in this particular form i'm using the
 tab key
 to separate the different entries as
 enter submits the form
 and i'm hitting enter at the end and as
 you see i can use show users in db and i
 see the user showing up and i can hide
 them again
 okay very good so i'll stop the
 recording so now let's look at the
 individual actions so if i take this
 first action you see
 it seems like it didn't register the
 event no it automatically
 converted this to a set event which is
 just something that it would it's just
 more adapted for filling these dialogues
 in a stable way to be able to fill these
 input boxes in a stable way
 and if you want to debug it you can
 simply double click and you can see it's
 being filled properly
 one of the new things is that in the
 method here which is basically the event
 we have the you can trigger the unchange
 you can trigger on change and blur but
 you can also trigger on change and enter
 key
 so normally when you record it will
 capture your keys properly but you can
 also of course take an individual one
 and change it accordingly
 so that's one of the things that are
 really useful
 the other thing is that we've also moved
 this before we had a lot of details on
 each event
 now
 all the more complex things can be found
 in the kebab menu up here so if you look
 at it here you now have things like
 treat hidden elements as not found which
 can be useful sometimes that we don't
 try to click on things in the interface
 there are hidden
 one of the
 places you want to do that often it's
 totally fine
 but sometimes it's good to do it because
 you might want maybe it's waiting for
 some process and then it's going to
 become unhidden but this is for you to
 play around with
 the other thing is of course we
 automatically retry when we can't find
 an element sometimes you want to disable
 this so use never retry on missing
 element
 and then we have some a kind of a
 special one which is support set value
 on read only and that's to be able to
 enter into a read-only box which very
 rarely should be used it's just some
 very specific cases
 and then we have some advanced features
 i will probably cover this in a separate
 video
 one thing that can be worth noting is if
 i now go
 to the
 the enter key i did when i clicked save
 to db i didn't use the mouse there you
 see here again
 instead of method here you have a key
 method and then of course you also have
 more options you usually want to use
 group this is the typical thing we
 emulate the mouse down the press and the
 mouse up which covers most cases but of
 course you can also do something where
 you want to
 just do the key down key press or key up
 event and then of course the character
 key is 13 and if you want to emulate
 some sort of holding into control alt or
 shift you can set that here as well and
 this is normally enough for most
 applications
 one thing
 worth noticing is if you hit the dot dot
 dot here you might have some different
 options here so that's always worth
 taking a look and it's not so often you
 need to set these and we try to keep it
 less complex here so
 that's the change so i hope that
 simplifies the ui a little bit
