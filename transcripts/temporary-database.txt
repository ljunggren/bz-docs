Transcript for [Feature Highlight: Temporary database](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9mbyQASx1A) by [Merlin](https://merlin.foyer.work/)

 now i would like to introduce the
 temporary database
 um
 you can find that this icon here you see
 it says temporary database
 and this functionality which i think is
 pretty novel i haven't seen this in any
 other test tool is something we came up
 with
 working with api tests
 and as we've developed the api testing
 in Boozang
 we've seen an increasingly need
 increasing need that
 when you have one api request you can
 have a consecutive request that is
 depending on
 data from a former request
 so
 let's take an example with this would
 typically happen
 i have a lot of features here cucumber
 features
 where let's say we take
 order management here for instance
 where i have a number of given condition
 that leads up kind of does the data seed
 that creates the data that allows me to
 run the scenario so in this case it's a
 brewery platform so it's given i am a
 brewer i add a product i set the
 inventory which is the stock and i set
 the price and then i can order the
 product
 in order to speed things up we wanted to
 convert these given conditions to api
 tests so they're not done in the ui so
 let's see what that would look like we
 will take one of the
 modules here that i did convert
 here inventory management i am a brewer
 and i call them just api i add a product
 dash api
 what we noticed was that of course
 given i am a brewer this contains the
 login and that will give you a user the
 user is tied to a company etc etc etc so
 of course in my product request i'm
 going to need data from a step before
 so
 i've just created some helper tests to
 kind of illustrate this and of course
 this is fairly complex functionality and
 i think as you start playing around with
 this it will make much more sense but
 one way i illustrate this is basically
 an api creation i want to make sure that
 i can do find the company which is
 basically the first condition and then i
 want to create a new product
 so let's see what this looks like
 if i'm here i can actually delete all
 this which is the temporary database
 which is in the local storage in the
 browser so now this is clear i don't see
 anything
 and now what i want to do here is i want
 to play this step and we're going to see
 what happens i'm just going to run
 one iteration with this data
 what's interesting here is really to be
 able to
 without kind of creating these
 of course you could create a carrier
 variable that says
 project
 user equals or project company equals
 and then carry it onwards
 but i'll show you this is a slightly
 more elegant solution and it works
 really well especially in combination
 with the open api where we have ever all
 the api requests really organized into
 modules in a very very nice way so let's
 open this as you can see we now have
 the user
 the company the container the product
 the sub product the inventory and the
 sellable which is all this stuff that i
 set and i'm going to show you very soon
 how i set these
 but in the meantime let's look at this
 right if i want to understand how this
 data was set i can troubleshoot it
 directly here we're going to do the
 first thing as you can see we have an
 authentication request and you can also
 look at the response and
 if you go down the list here you can see
 how the the product is being called and
 you can see the you can see the response
 and remember you can always double click
 here to open the tree
 completely
 so let's look how this looks in practice
 well
 well first of all okay the temporary
 database is kind of
 populated automatically and i'm going to
 show you how this is done if i do look
 at the company call and i go into the
 api setting
 and if i go to end script
 you see this ai api ad data which is
 part of the default setup
 this is the one that adds it
 into the temporary database
 and then when i want to use it
 i use something here in create product
 i use this and i'm going to show you
 here inside try
 you're going to see that i'm using
 something here of course it's just to
 debug but what i would use is exist
 company id and it will automatically
 take
 the latest company id and if you want to
 know what was the latest company id that
 was retrieved imagine you want to have
 the latest one in case we store usually
 10
 company ids so you want to if it was a
 test before that called something that
 got the company id in the response you
 want to catch the latest one okay
 so here you can see we open up the
 company ids you see there is a little
 star that indicates what would be used
 in an exist call so we know here and we
 can inspect in the data and we can see
 here this is indeed Boozang brewer ar
 which is the right
 data that we should use in this case
 so now you see a little bit on how you
 can um
 how you can store
 the things in the temporary database and
 then how you can kind of link this
 together and the way you would do this
 i'm just going to go very quickly into
 it but
 because of course this is pretty big
 functionality
 is that if you go into mapping pages and
 you go into
 one of these
 fields so you press settings and you go
 into fields you're gonna see that the
 company id i set this exist company id
 so i basically
 map out all the modules and all the data
 that go into these modules for the api
 requests but of course this kind of ai
 view for api testing is a separate
 bigger topic to talk about but the new
 feature that we added
 specifically is this temporary data base
 which is super useful when working with
 more
 advanced end-to-end api tests
