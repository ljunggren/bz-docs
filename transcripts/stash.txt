Transcript for [Boozang feature: Stash and Stash Pop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXUsK1S4eRQ) by [Merlin](https://merlin.foyer.work/)

 now in the busang versioning control we
 also support stash so let me illustrate
 stash for you this is very similar to G
 stash let's say I'm in my uh feature
 Branch I'm going to switch to my feature
 Branch here this could be any branch and
 as you know when we go to modifications
 here we see no changes here this would
 be the similar view as the git ad so let
 me do a change I'm now going into module
 B and I'm creating a test called test B
 okay inside module B when I have this
 test we would be able to see it in the
 change list here and normally you would
 work on this and then you would maybe
 commit this right but let's say you
 don't want to do that let's say well I
 was wondering how something I wanted to
 go back to the head of the branch but I
 don't want to revert my changes I just
 want to compare to the branch original
 state to see was this really working was
 it not similar like you would do with
 Git stash so go in here and go ahead and
 stash the I uh the changes right and now
 I'm going back to my module B and as you
 can see where is my test B the test B
 has been stashed so now I could test
 certain things in the two let's say how
 was it working before was my changes
 good or not and then I can go back here
 and now instead I click on the stash
 list and I can now see my stash here in
 the list so now what I can do is I can
 simply pop this stash meaning bring this
 change
 back and here if you want to learn more
 about stash and stash pop you can look
 at also the documentation on git around
 its very well documented feature now
 when I go back into my module I will now
 see my test B so stash is very useful
 ful you're working on something you
 think you want to commit your work but
 maybe you want to go back to the top of
 the branch before you did these changes
 see what was going on there compare it
 and then maybe just pop it before you do
 the the commit so this is get stash for
 you which I think is very useful not as
 you don't do it as frequent as you
 regular commit regular merges but useful
 in some cases where you think you might
 have made a mistake
