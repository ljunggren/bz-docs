Transcript for [Boozang Feature: Looping over test case data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C-mJGLBGb0) by [Merlin](https://merlin.foyer.work/)

 we've also
 launched a new feature to how to enable
 loop data when using the keyword data so
 i'm going to show that now on a simple
 test case
 what we were doing before of course is
 we've already always supported you to be
 able to loop over spreadsheet data or
 vectors but we realized that when people
 do this the ux wasn't that
 simple to do
 so now what we do is we
 have reserved the keyword data that will
 automatically
 kind of assume that it's loop data so we
 have this test case on the lab.busan.com
 that just fills the form so i'm just
 going to really simply create
 a loop condition where we take
 information from a csv file
 and we fill out this form
 so bear with me
 if you go here instead of product you go
 into the test case
 and you'll add a csv data and you use
 the keyword data
 you will
 automatically be prompted if you want to
 use this as loop date on this test case
 so here of course you would use
 something like first name
 maths
 and here you would use tab
 to separate these fields last name
 let's say
 youngren
 but of course we want to have more data
 so we'll also use wen shang lee's name
 here so now of course we have
 two rows of data that we can loop over
 here what i would typically do
 is i would just very simply
 add a javascript action here
 where
 i would just kind of now i will override
 the parameter first name and parameter
 last name
 using the keyword loop first name and
 loop last name and as you can see both
 on parameter and on loop you will have
 the autocomplete to make it very simple
 right so you don't make any mistakes
 now we're going to go ahead and launch
 this so when i press play we also
 kind of specified for you
 which
 do you want to run all the csv lines or
 do you want to pick one line
 or do you want to pick
 you know from zero to a one but in this
 case
 i think what we want to do is run
 all the data so just go ahead and press
 ok and you should see the loop over the
 form over the data begin
 mats young grin the same as before and
 then wen cheng li
 so this is of course very very good when
 you're doing data provisioning or doing
 kind of
 things where you need to do
 maybe you have to add a number of
 persons to taste pagination or you need
 to like delete the number of persons to
 clean up some data or something like
 that so this is very useful
 of course this has been with busan from
 the beginning the only news is that you
 see here is that when you use
 the data keyword we suggest for you to
 use the loop data and what we do behind
 the scenes is setting this under test
 setting basic info
 we have this enable loop data here
