Transcript for [Boozang Feature: Xray integration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ia2dh-9EQ) by [Merlin](https://merlin.foyer.work/)

 as you might know we integrate with the
 test management software x-ray
 which is an extension into jira that we
 like a lot
 we've had that integration in play for
 more than two years now and it's been
 working really really well
 but we thought what can we do to
 supercharge this
 so maybe you remember before we could
 already uh you know get the execution
 results back in x-ray see all the
 reports and see the evidences in there
 so this is really really cool and this
 kind of allows you to do manual testing
 and automated testing and view them the
 same way in x-ray
 one thing that we did though now
 we've
 extended the x-ray integration
 uh using our extension so here in
 extension if you add your x-ray host
 here which is actually the api you're
 supposed to put here
 and you can also put your jenkins host
 here
 where you have the Boozang tests
 now all of a sudden you get two new
 icons in x-ray one thing that runs the
 tests in jenkins and another one that
 opens the scenario in Boozang
 so
 as usual we use the api to synchronize
 Boozang with x-ray and this is working
 well but of course now if you see a
 problem you can relaunch it
 from your ci server and we could put it
 in place for any ci server here it's a
 very simple integration so you can
 execute any x-ray test here and also you
 can open the test directly in Boozang
 which helps with an even tighter
 mapping so we're super excited about
 this
 and i hope i will be able to show you
 more after we have this in production a
 little while
