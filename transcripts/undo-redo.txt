Transcript for [Boozang Feature: Undo / Redo and Test revisions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwnujKLPah0) by [Merlin](https://merlin.foyer.work/)

 i will now explain the undo redo
 functionality in Boozang we've had that
 now for a couple of years but we've
 updated it to save everything
 server-side in the database this will
 give you
 a revision history for each test so if
 you make a mistake you can go back but
 it also means that if someone else has
 done an update to your test that you can
 undo and get the revision history of
 that test
 so we also encourage you we maybe
 haven't got the presentation down so
 that might change a little bit but in
 brief let's say i do a couple of changes
 here to this test
 instead of saving it in the local
 storage it's server-side so what i will
 see here if i use this drop down is i
 will see all the updates so either i'll
 just do the one update that you saw
 there
 or
 of course the other one as well right
 and you can do many in a row
 if you look at the redo functionality
 you can also see here that of course you
 can redo the same things and as you can
 see when you hover you also see what
 change was being done it's a little
 complex right now the presentation of
 this so it requires a little bit of
 patience but usually of course you know
 what you just did
 so
 it one difference here is of course we
 see who did that change so you can also
 redo if there is someone else doing the
 change one interesting thing if i choose
 to undo this
 and for instance i record a number of
 key presses
 it should be able to when you
 undo this you should actually be able to
 see
 uh a number of things you could redo so
 it actually kind of gives you the i the
 option to branch out
 and kind of pick your redo history so
 this is kind of an advanced case but it
 could be useful in some cases where you
 basically did
 maybe you've done that before you do an
 action
 on top of something and then you lose
 your
 undo histories you can't redo the
 changes basically
 so
 a little bit about that i encourage you
 to let us know i find that maybe this
 presentation could be done a little bit
 better so play around with it and let us
 know what you think but i think this
 will really help you when you make a
 mistake to a certain test or you don't
 know why a certain test stopped working
 then you can usually go back to a
 revision that was working so i think
 this would be very helpful
