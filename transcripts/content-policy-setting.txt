Transcript for [Boozang Feature: Content Policy tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5WifRqufwY) by [Merlin](https://merlin.foyer.work/)

 let me demonstrate
 um
 the setting here which is loading
 element
 which we just released for the 680
 feature release
 before i do that i just want to do a
 little recap and explain the content
 policy window all the stuff you can set
 here
 this
 app dictionary is a little bit
 experimental a way to support
 multi-language um
 we don't have any users
 right now using this functionality since
 we launched it so i think
 this would require a little bit with us
 working with you to make this
 really good
 something that is very very useful is
 ignore request url as you know Boozang
 always listens to
 all the requests that goes out from the
 browser and waits for it to make sure
 that all the api requests are completed
 that way if you have a slow uh answering
 api
 uh the test will still run stable so
 it's very very powerful but sometimes
 there is stuff like socket request you
 don't want to wait for you will add them
 here in ignore request url okay
 priority item for data select is for
 instance a cypress has a certain element
 there's a few of these that recommend
 you setting specific
 attributes you can just add them here
 and you can use wild cards for me i use
 the data bset attribute so that will be
 used by the dome picker and have a
 priority in case you're using it for a
 button etc
 we also have ignore classes you very
 rarely need to update this the typical
 one is of course active uh that that or
 has changed or checked that's very
 typical ignore classes
 i think if you have something specific
 for your applications
 especially if it's kind of in your local
 language or something like that it's
 good to add it here so you make sure
 that we don't try to use this
 in the domain policy and the element
 selection policy
 text attributes these are just useful
 for instance your login often has
 placeholders so it's good to use these
 in the selection policy
 so that's something you want to keep in
 mind
 clickable element usually these are a
 and button you usually don't have to set
 this but maybe you have something
 special like a span or something that is
 clickable then you can add it here and
 it will help us when we do our different
 policies for for the element selection
 and last but not least this new one here
 the loading element is a way to capture
 um for instance here if i reload this
 page
 there will be a kind of a spinner or
 something like that then you can capture
 it here and then Boozang will
 automatically wait for that element to
 disappear uh also making your tests to
 run
 more stable
