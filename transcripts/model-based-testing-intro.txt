hello I am mats ljunggren I am the CEO forBoozang and today I'm going to demo somemodelbasedtesting so why you do modelbased testingwell we are going to make an argumentit's a better approach for complex appsbecause even though it's more work upfront in the long run it's so mucheasier to build on top of and also somuch less work to maintain today we willuse the Boozang tool to demo that but uhif you want to use the same concepts forselenium Cypress or play right I thinkthere's a lot you can borrow from thisin this example we use this uh projectplanning application called bi um andthe reason why we picked this is becausethere has a lot of complexity it's avery strong modular structure as you cansee projects client resources and insideof these you have a lot of dependenciesand this is where it's really good touse modelbased testing if you're notfamiliar with the Boozang tool we willstart by creating an AI model herecreate the project module okay and whenwe click into this we have a couple ofoptions to choose from a blank using thecrud uh create update delete template oryou can clone another module that you'veuh made previously we're just going togo ahead and use the default templateas you can see you now get um a basicoutline of forms and things that youneed to set and this use works for manymany applications actually it'ssurprising but if you want of course youcan customize this completely howeveryou want and also of course we supportany number of operations not just createupdate delete what you want to do is youwant to start by adding the entry pointto the module which is this top linkhere called projects then you want to goahead and create create has two steps asyou can see two clicks so in order tohandle these cases we have somethingcalledpre-step so make sure that that pre-stepwascaptured double clickit and capture the mainstep we have the path to go to thecreate project form so just click playon the form to make sure that the stepsyou've done so far arecorrect now we want to add the differentmodels uh the fields we can use addmodel or batch addmodel as you can see here we're onlyadding the required fields forSimplicity the start date is a date somake sure you set the right type and theproject categories inN we use the readymadeselectors so this is a component a datecomponent also we can use the readymaderegular Expressions to instead ofsetting it to today which is defaultwe'll use last Monday and these regularexpression we support I use last Mondayand next Monday for start and end dateby default it's a save button here ifyou fill it out it's an addbutton now we're ready to go to theworkfloweditor simply add create project and wewill have a cucumber scenarioautogenerated here and one of the reasonwhy we use cucumber is so we support alot of the CI plugins for reporting andalso X-ray and other test managementplatforms so now we have a given nothinghere you would usually add I am loggedin you could record that or use ourauthentication module as well when Icreate something then you would do avalidation but right now we just have awstep and as you can see it uses somepredefined module and some number andthis is just all regular Expressionsthat you that are setting this bydefault this of course you canmanipulate however youlike as you can see this is working wecreated our first test so now let's addavalidation here we see we have a datatable here so if I go to Project we seeit automatically select this tableotherwise we'll have to change this pathbut what we want to do here becausethere could be a lot of projects andpagination we want to record some prepshere first click view demo to make surewe have the same view always and thenenter some data here in the in thesearchbox here the powerful thing is that nowbecause we cach all the project namesand variables we save it in a atemporary database you can now use oneof ourpredefined um data which you can seehere if you go into the temporarydatabase which is here you can see allthe values you have here for theproject now we've added a validation solet's just make sure to add this to thescenario in the dataflow as scenario with both an action anda validation so let's try and run thisand here it can ask you to use the storedata we're not going to do that now butof course this is really good for yourcir runs to be able to build uponexisting data uh to speed up executiontimes and that's one of the advantagesof always keeping things in memoryas you can see here we've now created avery simple fully datadriven test whereyou can of course customized the namethe dates everything by driving datainto the test and automatically makesure to update validations conditionsEtc
