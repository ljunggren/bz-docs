Transcript for [Boozang Introduction: Cucumber Features and Scenarios](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jNc2kpdMEo) by [Merlin](https://merlin.foyer.work/)

 as we've redone a lot of the cucumber
 functionality i'm going to create a
 couple of videos that shows you
 how to work with cucumber now in Boozang
 so what i've done is i've created an
 empty project for us to demo on
 and so what i'll do is
 just like you would start
 this is the same view that you would
 have and remember as usual we're using
 the lab
 okay
 and the good thing is that now in the
 lab we've added cucumber feature
 and scenario specifications so you have
 something to get started with there will
 be an upcoming udemy course where we go
 into cucumber in more depth but right
 now
 here is a little taste of what you're
 going to see
 as usual
 remember when you're in Boozang and you go
 up to the main navigation will have
 modules which is the code domain where
 you test live and in cucumber that would
 be the test step implementations and
 then you have the features which is the
 business domain where your cucumber
 feature and scenario lives
 of course you can use as usual the
 import feature function
 and here as usual you can also
 add an integration point where you can
 synchronize i can show you really
 quickly under integration you can now
 synchronize with a bunch of different
 systems you can have features in gitlab
 github bitbucket
 x-ray and acer okay so you can
 synchronize the features directly from
 them where they would be the master
 system and Boozang would be the slave so
 all the test step implementations will
 live in Boozang
 and of course the execution engine and
 then the actual cucumber files would
 live in your version control system or
 in x-ray
 but right now we're going to do it keep
 it simple no integration points and
 remember now i'm just clicking new
 feature
 so
 before we made it a little bit more
 complex where you had to create the
 scenarios individually but right now you
 can actually import a feature straight
 away so we're going to import the sorted
 list feature so we're going to go into
 sorted list cucumber specification and
 we're going to copy all this so just
 ctrl a
 control c
 and then instead of filling out the
 feature name just click import features
 and paste all of this straight into
 Boozang and will auto generate the
 features
 and the scenarios inside that means that
 in Boozang that would mean it's kind of a
 you know a feature
 you will create the future name sorted
 list then you create a test suite sorted
 list so you can run all the scenarios
 inside the feature and then when you
 click into it the feature will of course
 show up as not implemented
 so that's one way to get really quickly
 started with Boozang so let me i mean
 cucumber in Boozang and remember that all
 of these are executable directly when
 they're imported they will just show us
 non not implemented in the report right
 you see this little yellow not
 implemented
 and under report you will see them as
 not implemented so that's what it would
 look like before you start linking
 test step implementations to them
 an alternative way if you don't want to
 synchronize if you want to create a
 scenario manually
 you can go into the feature
 and just click new scenario
 and of course you can now fill in
 given
 i
 have an item
 when
 i give
 it away
 then
 i shouldn't
 have it
 so now you can of course manually create
 something and let's say this is the
 item test right
 or
 keep it destructive give away
 item scenario okay
 and we go submit and as you can see
 i have an item i give it away i
 shouldn't have it so that's how simple
 it is to get started with the cue camper
 so the next
 uh
 video we're gonna look at how would you
 implement these things in Boozang
