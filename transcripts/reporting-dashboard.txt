Transcript for [Reporting dashboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I2eZVIwSQ8) by [Merlin](https://merlin.foyer.work/)

 okay let me talk about the feature
 reporting dashboard so this is a very
 big feature and the idea was before you
 used to have
 the Jenkins
 cucumber reports in one place you'll
 have the trend reports inside the IDE
 you'll have the root cause analysis
 maybe on your Jenkins but they're all
 different reports why not consolidate
 them improve them and give you a single
 stop
 to get all your reporting and draw
 business insights like a better
 management function and try and really
 understand what are the underlying
 issues in your application
 so the way you would set this up is
 you'll hit this little new uh reporting
 icon on your project and then you will
 add your main test Suite that you use on
 your CI server and remember you can add
 many here and then you can switch
 between them let's say you have one with
 regression test and one with full sanity
 maybe but don't worry about that let me
 just go into as soon as you set that up
 I prepared a report here so this project
 has a lot of data in it so then this
 starts becoming really interesting so
 you know you have one run two test runs
 not so much value you start having 10 50
 100 then you can see Trends and patterns
 and understand what's really going on
 with your application
 so the first thing you can see is at the
 top you'll have a Time and you'll think
 well for cucumbers that's really
 important no it's not the Cucumber
 report is just a snapshot but what it
 does is let's say I do last six months
 then
 what what you can see is that this top
 timeline where you can navigate becomes
 very long and you can actually go back
 to anywhere in time
 and look at those reports but not only
 that when you scroll down we recalculate
 these things you know all the averages
 where you compare and as you scroll down
 not only are you getting your cucumber
 overview where you have the feature
 breakdown with failed steps scenarios
 and features as you scroll down you also
 get your root cause analysis and as you
 can see I haven't defined these so these
 are the real
 problems that I'm getting from the
 application logs and remember you can
 now use this pen to match the error hash
 here to
 a real named
 error that you have a root cause and
 then you can say hey this might be an
 automation issue an application issue or
 this is unknown and then you can use
 that to provide even more information by
 clicking root courses here but I'll
 probably make a separate video on this
 because it's a quite elaborate on how to
 use this in a good way but as you scroll
 down now we have a long period of time
 so you see there's a lot of test data
 that I can see how the past percentage
 is evolving over time
 and I can also see the evolution of the
 execution time so let's say you made a
 database upgrade some refactoring you
 can see how did that event affect the
 execution time
 and then of course more complex you can
 see this aggregate result over the time
 period compared to the last result so
 here you can identify not only the
 anomalies or this this failure normal
 compared to the average run so you can
 also see is this execution time normal
 compared to the average time so the idea
 is here you will have an understanding
 of
 as soon as you start accumulating data
 over time instead of trying to go to
 Jenkins go to your X-ray go and get your
 root cause analysis and your Trend
 reports we get you everything on that in
 one place
 we allow for you to you know find these
 underlying root causes maybe some more I
 know this is an automation issue this is
 a real application issue you can link
 them to your own ticketing system so
 there's a lot in here to go over but
 please look at this explore it and let
 us know what you want to see here
