Transcript for [Boozang Feature: Generating an API test from the UI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKmGBlfnGAw) by [Merlin](https://merlin.foyer.work/)

 one of the advantages in busan is that
 as it supports both ui and api test
 we've implemented a functionality where
 you can auto generate
 api tests from actions in the ui so let
 me demonstrate that
 what i'll start by doing is in a module
 i'll go into i'll choose api test and
 create a new api test
 api actions you can also add into
 regular tests but we recommend you using
 the api test because it makes things a
 little bit simpler
 so i'm just going to call this form fill
 in api
 and i need to pick my api host in this
 case
 the api is hosted on api.busan.com
 very cool
 so of course now we can create start
 creating manually filling out the query
 the body the headers and create the api
 test very similar to a tool like postman
 or we can actually just go ahead and
 delete this one
 and use this little api capture right
 here so what you want to start by doing
 is you want to delete everything in this
 dialog so it's empty
 because it's always registering apis but
 if you really want to generate an api
 test it's important that you hit this
 record button okay
 now let me test here so again we're
 using
 form fill in the lab
 and
 while we're filling the form we don't
 expect anything because in this case
 it's not talking to the api
 it waits to do the post until you click
 save to db where the data is submitted
 to the
 to the backend right to the api
 and then you're going to see the post
 being generated here in the dialog
 so now we could go ahead and save this
 but what i'm going to do as you can see
 here you can also see the data that it
 used here on the hover which is very
 good for troubleshooting and for making
 sure that the right information was
 captured
 what i'm going to do is i'm actually
 going to go ahead and click this button
 which
 executes the get
 and also the delete
 now you see all the api requests the
 post get and delete and i'm going to
 save all of these into my api test
 generate api action okay and i'm hitting
 save
 now
 in order to understand if this is
 working or not of course i want to make
 sure that we have no users we have no
 users here on the database and i'm going
 to go ahead and execute this post
 request
 as we see
 it has now automatically
 made the post
 to the
 to the backend api so we already have an
 action that we can use to create the
 user
 but we also have the get request which
 we can double click here and in order to
 see the result here of course we can go
 into
 in the try tab in the result tab we can
 go and see the outgoing request
 and also we can see that i'm going to
 move this over a little bit
 we can also see the response here
 so this is a something you can play
 around with a lot
 but it's very very
 good to especially get started very fast
 to create an api test of course what you
 probably want to do
 is go into for instance here for the
 post you will have the data in the body
 so you probably want to parameterize
 this but i'm going to go into that more
 how you would kind of edit these api
 requests and make sure you can kind of
 make them more versatile and data driven
 in another video but this is
 a quick overview on how you can use the
 api recorder to capture api tests simply
 in the browser
