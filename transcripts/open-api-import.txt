Transcript for [Feature Highlight: Open API import](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfzGLTWBiWM) by [Merlin](https://merlin.foyer.work/)

 now i want to talk about a new feature
 um that we actually launched in beta
 about a month ago but we'll be doing
 continuous improvements to this feature
 uh and now of course i also know how to
 use it well
 and this is the open api import and what
 it allows us to do
 is to take so i'm just going to create a
 new
 project here in our staging environment
 to
 um
 to illustrate this feature
 what you want to do is always um
 is that you want to set up
 the
 so i'm just going to use the url here
 it's not so important but let's use the
 lab
 docbusang.com which is our usual
 demo site i recommend checking out the
 udemy course on that
 here
 as soon as we've done this of course i
 would
 set up
 the login
 basically the authorization basically
 making sure that we can get both the
 login working but also that you can get
 a token for the api if the api requires
 an authentication token so this is where
 it's really good to mix
 ui and api testing because oftentimes
 in the application you'll have the token
 available
 in the web browser and you can then use
 that to do the api requests and this is
 typical when
 like we do in busan often we mix
 api and ui tests okay
 so remember the first thing you want to
 do is go through here and set up the ai
 authorization
 by clicking this button and making sure
 that you have a test case for logging in
 logging out and retrieving the token
 when that's done
 now we can go ahead
 and import the api spec and what you
 want to do is you want to be in the root
 you want to click this and then we'll
 have import open api specification
 as an option here
 and
 if you have
 an api spec
 that we cannot import i really really
 urge you to reach out to us at support
 at busan.com because the open api spec
 is pretty loose
 and we've tried this maybe on 10 or 15
 different specifications but your
 specification can actually
 a lot of developers the open api spec is
 not so strict and it's different so we
 love to learn and expand the capability
 here still a little bit experimental and
 a little bit cutting edge to make this
 work
 anyways i'm going to show you when you
 have an example where it works pretty
 well and this is uh i'm working with a
 company a marketplace company for
 micro
 uh products like craft products
 so in this case
 i'm gonna import this and it's gonna be
 here it's in
 dock
 and we're gonna find this
 where is that let's see
 okay there it is
 so this is the open api specification
 and of course what you typically would
 like to do is you would add the
 authorization module here and then you
 would add the token by clicking this
 checkbox so that would be the typical
 way of doing this but what i'm going to
 do go ahead is just to kind of build the
 module structure so what it does is it
 will create an api
 module structure based on the open api
 spec
 so we're going to go ahead here and
 import and of course this api is very
 very big and as you can see
 you see we have a lot of modules here
 a lot of different things in a
 marketplace you know you'll have
 you know the the different users that
 are tied to different companies
 and in there you know you'll have a
 company it's going to own a number of
 products you'll have a number of formats
 uh which would be the sub products and
 then of course these are tied to
 inventory settings and to prices and
 then there are you have orders etc etc
 so it's a really really complex setup uh
 that's what where this becomes really
 really powerful and as you can see you
 can move around modules into each other
 if you believe they should be sub
 modules etc etc but right here i'm just
 going to click continue and i'm actually
 going to choose a prefix here you'll do
 that if you want to but as you can see
 now you have api prefix on all the
 modules and maybe this is useful in case
 you mix this with your
 regular uh you know modules where you
 might want to keep the api module and
 the regular ui module separate so it
 depends if you kind of want to keep them
 separate or not
 i go ahead and i click continue
 and then you can see now it's going to
 kind of tell you it's going to tell you
 this is all i'm going gonna do and as
 you can see there's a little warning
 here
 and
 we see this a lot with open api spec
 it's like they give the id the api can
 actually take the id which is usually
 something that's being generated
 by the api so i usually remove the id
 and i do that for all the end points
 and just means that for instance
 it doesn't i never would use the id when
 i would retrieve
 something in in the post like
 when i want to create something right
 and i wouldn't send the id in the post i
 would create it and expect to get the id
 back so that's all all that means and
 that now comes to the the work you got
 to do and this is a little bit of work
 and you would go in here and you would
 do the foreign key mapping and i'm going
 to try and explain this
 this is like an alias right so
 very often you have a number of
 aliases where in this case i'm going to
 illustrate something for instance
 a brewer id here
 that's a company right
 so for instance if you say create
 company you want to know you want to tie
 it together if it replies with the
 company id if you're mapping something
 later you kind of want to tell them a
 brewer id as a company id and the way
 you would do that is you would basically
 select
 company id
 and then we use this thing that is
 usually takes an existing company id and
 this can automatically actually extract
 the company id
 from the temporary database which is
 something super powerful
 so now also a buyer id would also be a
 company id and as you see it remembers
 here so what you want to do is probably
 you want to test drive this one time
 and then play around with it and see
 what it did and then you probably want
 to do this properly you know
 so that's what you do you'll go through
 here and you'll do all these mappings
 and maybe you would need some developer
 help in case it wasn't you who've been
 working and developing this api and
 you'll go ahead and start this process
 and as you can see
 all the modules are being generated
 and what we're trying to do here is of
 course
 we're trying to create the module for
 each data type
 then we want to create kind of crud
 operations as specified in the open api
 spec create edit delete right
 and
 then and also find right
 which is usually the get request
 and then
 what you want to do is we also want to
 try and capture the different
 dependencies
 and
 do the mapping as well best as we can
 and here you can actually see
 what are the mappings that we've done
 and if i would have done my work better
 of course we would see much more things
 that would be matched
 a little note that
 um
 kind of
 we're just going to let this finish
 that relationship that we saw
 can be found here in in the import we'll
 have that review module
 initial parameter mapping
 so you can go back
 and find that here
 if you see what i mean so you can always
 go back and of course also map here if
 you need to
 so
 let's go into one of them for instance
 companies
 you would go in
 and
 here let's see it's a little bit of a
 bug it looks like
 let's do this
 let's take
 let's do a refresh just in case
 so this is pretty novel functionality so
 maybe when i didn't do all the mappings
 we had some issue
 but here you can see i think it just
 needed a refresh
 and as you can see we now see the kind
 of api
 module here which is also kind of part
 of our ai functionality when you do
 model based development your ui would
 also be mapped
 using this kind of thing but of course
 you can also switch
 between tests and the old classical view
 where you have the api tests
 and you have the the regular tests
 we also try to generate a scenario which
 is the create scenario where we have as
 you can see
 a number of steps
 but of course this is a lot of guesswork
 on our side so we're going to go back
 to this view and what you can see here
 what's very important to note this if
 you hit the settings
 you'll have all the fields available
 here and there you can see exactly what
 did we do and as you can see we made
 some guesses on the data format but here
 you can of course
 modify this and this as you can see is a
 regular expression so it will generate
 some and you can also set dependencies
 which can be very very useful
 in this case let's look at find products
 and how you want to look at this as you
 can see it's created it'd be said skip
 by default which means it will actually
 skip this parameter
 so if you want to for instance
 find
 a product or something you would just
 want to make sure that when you go in
 here as you can see you can select now
 okay
 use this regular expression to generate
 this field
 but you can also
 find
 if you have in the temporary database
 already a company id available it will
 show up here in the drop down
 so this gives you a little bit of a
 feeling of course this is
 highly complex functionality uh we are
 trying to kind of
 do as much work and as much of the heavy
 lifting as possible for you to get
 started with your api tests from the
 open api specification
 a bit experimental but what i really
 want you to take away is
 if you have any problems here don't
 hesitate to reach out because we love
 if your open api specification isn't a
 secret we love and see how different
 companies are solving this kind of open
 api
 how they uh
 you know design their api and then we
 can also make our tool much better at
 doing as much of the work for you as
 possible
 so
 there'll be more
 videos on this particular functionality
 but here is an introduction of how you
 want to think
 when you get started with open api
