Transcript for [Boozang Feature: Loop data view](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHDmcl2pIh0) by [Merlin](https://merlin.foyer.work/)

 sometimes in busan
 there is a need to do a little more
 robot process automation and as you know
 we have very good support for this you
 know when you have stable tests you can
 also provision data uh especially when
 you have application where there might
 be an api missing or something you can
 solve this by doing the things using an
 automation tool in directly in the
 browser right
 so because i've been doing this recently
 a lot uh i've we decided to improve this
 a little bit so before you saw that we
 improved this already
 by
 improving the csv view so if i go into
 data here and i click on this csv file
 you can see the presentation of the csv
 file is very very simple
 we've also added beforehand right the
 fact that you can select the interval of
 the data start index and end index you
 want to run
 but one thing that we've added now in
 this release here i'm working on one of
 our clients here the pivoha platform
 where we input
 brewer data
 or retailer data into a platform
 what we've done here
 is we've also changed added this report
 here so if i make this a little bigger
 you can see that we have a loop data
 view
 where i'm going to stop this for now
 if you go to the loop data view it's
 going to show you exactly the data that
 was processed and you can also copy this
 to a csv that becomes like a report what
 was processed what wasn't processed
 and remember
 here you can actually add
 a column of the loop data with for
 instance a processing status or
 something so like that so you can add an
 unlimited number of columns with
 statuses like was this process correctly
 etc etc so this makes this ideal for
 uh tasks like
 that are more like robot process
 automation so i think this is really
 really cool and remember that you
 make sure to copy this
 the report after it's done so you get
 your results back
