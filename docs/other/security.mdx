## Fragment security

When installing the bz-fragment we get the security of the web browser without the limitation of being bound to Chrome extension policy. This limits cross-browser execution but allows running Boozang without the need of any Extension. 

Note: This requires access to the application directory to install an HTML fragment. 

## GDPR

As we are running locally in your web browser, itÂ´s been easier to be GDPR compliant than for regular Cloud-testing services. We recommend that you'll host sensitive test data in CSV files hosted on your servers. That way, the data will never be loaded into our Cloud and be present in the browser local storage on the test computers.

## Hosting

In our Cloud, we host the data you enter into our system and the tests, including our proprietary element selectors. To get an understanding of the kind of data we store, you can look at the Source tab on any test. Our servers are located in Canada.
