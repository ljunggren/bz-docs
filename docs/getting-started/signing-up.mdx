## Signing  up / Logging in

You can sign-up for Boozang from the Boozang homepage at https://boozang.com. The sign-up link will take you to https://ai.boozang.com. If you are in Europe or Asia, try switching to our European site https://eu.boozang.com. These are the Boozang application servers, which are responsible for communicating with any instances of the Boozang tool, which is running locally on the client-side. 

This is also where an administrator can maintain different teams and different projects, without having to launch anything client-side.
