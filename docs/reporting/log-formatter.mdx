In using the reports provided by the open-source reporting engine for Cucumber, we found the report to sometimes be inadequate.

We therefor created the Boozang log formatter, which takes the Boozang execution logs and formats it into an easy to readreport, 
which directly links to the Boozang tool. Here, you can sort on the following different aspects, like

- Completion
- Id
- Name
- Result
- Performance
- Worker

You can also automatically open the Boozang tool from certain key places in the report, and see failure screenshots.=

In a way, this is a way to super-charge the system log, and another great advantage to the Cucumber standard reports is that
this formatted system log can be monitored while the test run is executing, not afterwards.
