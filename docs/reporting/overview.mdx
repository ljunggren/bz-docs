Reporting is an important aspect of test automation because it helps to track the progress, results, and overall effectiveness of the automation process. A good reporting system can provide valuable insights and help to identify areas of improvement, as well as highlight successes and achievements.

Here are a few specific reasons why reporting is important in test automation:

- It helps to ensure that the automation process is running smoothly and efficiently, and can identify any issues or problems that may arise.
- It allows stakeholders to track the progress of the automation process and understand how it is contributing to the overall testing efforts.
- It can provide valuable data and metrics that can be used to optimize and improve the automation process over time.
- It helps to identify trends and patterns that may not be immediately apparent from looking at individual test results.
- It can help to build confidence in the automation process by providing a clear and transparent record of its results.

## Screenshots 

In Boozang we always generate screenshots for all action failures resulting in a element validation error or 
a failure to locate an element. 

## Evidences

Except for screenshots generated by errors, there are times where you explicitly want to make a screenshot,
for instance to provide evidence of a test running successfully. You do this with the function `$util.attachScreesnhotToReport`.

## Trend Reports

It's also important to be able to see how tests behave over time. You can access this report either from the *Report* view, 
or using the sidebar link in the test: *Check Result Trends*
