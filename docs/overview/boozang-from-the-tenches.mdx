The book “Boozang from the Trenches” is now available on the [Apress](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-9010-1) site and [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Boozang-Trenches-Automation-Enterprise-Environment-ebook/dp/B0BQV91G8Z/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3FF9LZE477M55&keywords=boozang&qid=1672079538&sprefix=boozeng%2Caps%2C219&sr=8-1).

The book idea is to complement the documentation already available here with real life examples and practical tips on automating end to end scenarios in an enterprise context.

## Summary

Test Automation is a key aspect of delivering high-quality software and reducing time to market. Several tools and approaches are available today, each with its own constraints and specificity. This book introduces Boozang, a codeless web automation tool, using a real-life enterprise project  as source for examples. 

You'll have the opportunity to learn the basic features of Boozang and how to implement end-to-end automated scenarios, mixing GUI and API actions. Integration with JIRA-XRay and Jenkins is also covered to show how Boozang can be used effectively in an enterprise environment. The book is filled with examples that go beyond the Boozang tool, and cover the setup of a test automation project in a real context, with practical solutions as well as open points for which we are still looking for new ideas. 
You will learn how to:

·         Install and set up a project with Boozang

·         Create a modular test suite and use Gherkin to define scenarios

·         Integrate Boozang with JIRA-XRay and work in a team with code branches

·         Build a Jenkins pipeline to execute the automated scenarios nightly and reduce the execution time via parallelism
