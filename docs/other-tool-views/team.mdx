###### Adding team members

It's quite straightforward to add a team member to the project. Any team members email you add will receive an email notification with instructions on how to join the project.

###### Access policy

Not all users are created the same. To learn about the details of the access policy check out the management interface at https://ai.boozang.com and check the project details. Here you can get a breakdown of the detailed access policy and also customize a role.

###### The CI user

Sometimes it's useful to create a CI user with only execute privileges. This way, anyone with access to the CI server will be limited to only run tests, not edit tests or invite other team members.

Tip: It's highly recommended to create a CI user with limited privileges and use the CI user token to run tests from any CI server. This will minimize any potential security problems or web socket conflicts. 

###### Chat

There is also project collaboration built-in. Use this to communicate with team members and see test updates as they happen in the project.

*Tip: This will also be used to link to Slack updates (Roadmap).*
