## The top bar

![Top bar](../images/topbar.png "Top bar")

- New tab

Open a new tab. 

- Current tab

Boozang supports tabbed navigation similar to a desktop IDE like VS Code. Helpful when working on several tests at once. 

- Navigation bar

The navigation bar tells you where you are in the project tree, and enables you to quickly navigate it. From the image

- Project: The New Lab
- Branch: master
- Module: Forms
- Test: New test

By clicking any entry or arrow in the navigation bar you can navigate the tree. For instance, to change branch, simply click "master". The navigation is similar to Jenkins, where clicking an entity will navigate you there, while clicking an arrow will allow you to navigate between modules and tests, respectively. 

- Bookmark 

Bookmark tests and modules as you see fit by clicking the star. Simply click the star a second time to remove bookmark. The bookmark menu will show on hover. 

- Search

Search the project for any test, module, or Cucumber test step. Use advanced testing to do more specific searches, like variable names or page elements. 

- Record

- Play

Plays the test from the URL given.

- Application URL

- Open Window

- Requests

Registers all requests to the back-end, such as Restful API calls. Click to open API "snoop" menu, that allows you to record API tests by doing UI interactions. 

- Test Settings

## The right bar


![example image](../images/toolbar.png "Tool bar")

- Switch view: Table / GUI

The switch view button toggles between table and diagram view.

The table view should be used when authoring tests, and is the view you will use a majority of the time. The GUI will is useful to understand how the test intercats with other tests. 

- Navigate to parent

Navigate up the testing tree. 

- Expand action rows

Expand the action rows to show more test information. The expanded view is useful to troubleshoot passing of parameters and customized exit conditions. 

- Lock

Lock the test case to prevent other team member from modifying the test. As tests are auto-saved in Boozang and all other team members recieve these updates automatically, all tests are unlocked by default. 

- Undo / Redo

Undo or Redo latest modification. 

- Delete

Deletes one or several actions.  You can also use the "Delete" key. 

*Tip: Use Ctrl/CMD functions to multi-select.*

- Disable

A disabled action is skipped when a test is run. Useful to debug tests. 

- Group

The group function group's actions together. This allows you do keep your test in order, and to skip a set of actions using the exit condition Exit Group. By using Else-group, this can be used to implement simple conditional functionality (compare: if / else)

*Tip: Use Ctrl/CMD functions to multi-select actions.*

- Generate test case

Breaks up a group of actions into a separate test and replaces the group with a reference to that test (Plug-test case). It allows you to quickly refactor your tests to remove duplicate action sequences.

*Tip: Use Ctrl/CMD functions to multi-select.*

- Cut / Copy /Paste

Standard Cut functionality. Use Cut and Paste to move actions between tests, tests between modules, or data between tests and modules.

*Tip: Use Ctrl/CMD functions to multi-select.*
