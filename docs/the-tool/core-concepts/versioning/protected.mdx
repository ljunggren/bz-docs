## Protected Branches and Merge Requests in Boozang

### Introduction
Protected branches in Boozang ensure that critical branches like `master` or `main` are safeguarded against direct changes. Merge requests are a way to review, discuss, and safely integrate new changes from different branches into these protected branches.

### Setting Up Protected Branches

#### Protecting a Branch
1. **Identify Critical Branches**: Commonly, branches like `master` or `release` are protected.
2. **Enable Protection**: In the branch settings, enable protection to prevent direct changes to these branches.

#### Configuring Protection Rules
- **Restrict Who Can Merge**: Specify which users or roles have the authority to merge changes into the protected branch.
- **Require Code Reviews**: Set up rules where merge requests must be reviewed and approved before merging.

### Working with Merge Requests

#### Creating a Merge Request
1. **Complete Your Work**: Finish the work in your feature or bug-fix branch.
2. **Commit Your Changes**: Ensure all changes are committed.
3. **Create Merge Request**: From your branch, create a merge request to the protected branch (e.g., `master`).

#### Review Process
- **Assign Reviewers**: Select team members to review the merge request.
- **Discuss Changes**: Use the merge request interface to discuss changes, request modifications, or give approvals.
- **Approve Merge**: Once the merge request meets all criteria, it can be approved by authorized personnel.

### Applying the Merge

#### Merging Changes
1. **Merge the Changes**: After approval, merge the changes from the feature or bug-fix branch into the protected branch.
2. **Resolve Conflicts if Any**: If there are merge conflicts, resolve them before completing the merge.

#### Post-Merge Steps
- **Verify Changes**: Ensure the merged changes work as expected in the protected branch.
- **Close the Merge Request**: After a successful merge, close the merge request to signify completion.

### Best Practices

- **Regular Updates**: Keep your feature or bug-fix branches regularly updated with the latest changes from the protected branch to minimize merge conflicts.
- **Clear Communication**: Use the merge request platform for clear communication regarding changes, reviews, and approvals.

### Conclusion
Protected branches and merge requests in Boozang are crucial for maintaining the integrity of critical branches and ensuring a collaborative and controlled approach to integrating new changes.
