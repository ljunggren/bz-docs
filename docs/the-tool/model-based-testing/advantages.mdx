- Auto-generated re-usable test steps: As the application model is created, the Boozang engine will create a series of auto-generated tests that can be used to build upstream tests. 

- Auto-generated workflows: As the application model is created, the Boozang engine will create simple workflow tests for common test scenarios. These will act as a blueprint to create all higher-order tests. 

- Test Stability: Model-based testing is completely different from recording scenarios, as tests are automatically updated as the model changes. This means if an aspect of the application changes, only that part of the model needs to be updated, and all tests will automatically be updated. 

- Graphical overview: By creating a model of your application, a full graphical representation of the application is created. This gives everyone in the application team a complete picture of all application logic, and ...

- Non-requirement driven tests: By modeling the application, the Boozang engine can auto-generate tests that do not originate from business requirements but are still important. This gives you a baseline of tests to work as a health check for the application functionality.
