###### Switch view: Table / GUI

The switch view button toggles between table and diagram view.

The table view should be used when authoring tests, and is the view you will use a majority of the time. The GUI will is useful to understand how the test intercats with other tests. 

###### Navigate to parent

Navigate up the testing tree. 

###### Expand action rows

Expand the action rows to show more test information. The expanded view is useful to troubleshoot passing of parameters and customized exit conditions. 

###### Lock

Lock the test case to prevent other team member from modifying the test. As tests are auto-saved in Boozang and all other team members recieve these updates automatically, all tests are unlocked by default. 

###### Undo / Redo

Undo or Redo latest modification. 

###### Delete

Deletes one or several actions.  You can also use the "Delete" key. 

*Tip: Use Ctrl/CMD functions to multi-select.*

###### Disable

A disabled action is skipped when a test is run. Useful to debug tests. 

###### Group

The group function group's actions together. This allows you do keep your test in order, and to skip a set of actions using the exit condition Exit Group. By using Else-group, this can be used to implement simple conditional functionality (compare: if / else)

*Tip: Use Ctrl/CMD functions to multi-select actions.*

###### Generate test case

Breaks up a group of actions into a separate test and replaces the group with a reference to that test (Plug-test case). It allows you to quickly refactor your tests to remove duplicate action sequences.

*Tip: Use Ctrl/CMD functions to multi-select.*

###### Cut / Copy /Paste

Standard Cut functionality. Use Cut and Paste to move actions between tests, tests between modules, or data between tests and modules.
