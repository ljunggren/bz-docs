- New tab

Open a new tab. 

- Current tab

Boozang supports tabbed navigation similar to a desktop IDE like VS Code. Helpful when working on several tests at once. 

- Navigation bar

The navigation bar tells you where you are in the project tree, and enables you to quickly navigate it. From the image

- Project: The New Lab
- Branch: master
- Module: Forms
- Test: New test

By clicking any entry or arrow in the navigation bar you can navigate the tree. For instance, to change branch, simply click "master". The navigation is similar to Jenkins, where clicking an entity will navigate you there, while clicking an arrow will allow you to navigate between modules and tests, respectively.
