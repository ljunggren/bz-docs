### Looping a test

A loop means to repeat execution until a certain condition is fulfilled. In Boozang, a data loop is like a for-condition running over a data set, meaning the test gets executed once for each data entry. 

<!-- ![loop](../images/loop.png) -->

To set a test to loop over a set of data (to repeat its execution for each data entry), click on the first line of the test (denoting the test settings) and click the Kebab icon -> Advanced. In "Loop data" select the data you want to loop over. The test will be run once for each data entry, and the current data entry will be available in the `$loop`handle. 

The following data formats are supported to drive loops

- CSV: The assigned `$loop` item will be of `Object` format (JSON) 
- Arrays:  The assigned `$loop`item will be of `Property` format (String) 
- Request data: This is supported if the fetched data is `CSV`or `Array`.

### Looping an action

We also support looping a single action. In the "Pre/End script" tag you can either add an array to loop over the values, or add a single integer to loop a fixed set of times. If you choose to loop over data, the value will be assigned to the `$action` variable.

```
["apple","banana","pear"]: loop 3 times, $action will get the value "apple", "banana", "pear"
5: loop action five times
```

## Keywords

<YouTubeEmbed embedId="zHDmcl2pIh0">Docusaurus green</YouTubeEmbed>

In data-driven testing, we support the keywords "bz-skip" and "bz-stop" to be able to trigger conditional functionality based on data. As soon as "bz-skip" occur the test will skip without generating a failure. If "bz-stop" occur the all upstream tests will stop without generating an error.
