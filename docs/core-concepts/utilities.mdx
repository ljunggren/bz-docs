## Keywords

<YouTubeEmbed embedId="zHDmcl2pIh0">Docusaurus green</YouTubeEmbed>

In data-driven testing, we support the keywords "bz-skip" and "bz-stop" to be able to trigger conditional functionality based on data. As soon as "bz-skip" occur the test will skip without generating a failure. If "bz-stop" occur the all upstream tests will stop without generating an error.
