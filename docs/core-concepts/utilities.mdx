 ## Notes

You can add notes to a test step, by clicking "Set notes / Todos" in the *Action Details* view. A note will show up as a 
blue badge in the action list, while a TODO will show up as a red badge. These can be very useful when leaving 
unfinished testwork, especially when working in teams.

## Execute as single action

Boozang default execution mode is *Execute as single action*. That means that form fills and 
similar actions are executed in groupwithout communicating with the IDE. This greatly speeds up 
test execution, but in some particular cases you might want to disable this.

To make sure an action is executed in isolation, simply go to *Action Details* / ... (three dot menu -> Non-rapid action

## Keywords

In data-driven testing, we support the keywords "bz-skip" and "bz-stop" to be able to trigger conditional 
functionality based on data. This mans as soon as a parameter is being sent with these keywords, a specific behavior is triggered.

As soon as "bz-skip" occur the test will skip without generating a failure. 

If "bz-stop" occur the all upstream tests will stop without generating an error.

## Identify Loading Status

In many applications there are loading indicators, such as spinners, to show the the application is not done rendering.

Boozang supports automatically waiting for these elements to dissapear before proceeding with the testing. 

As this is a global project setting, it increases
test stability and means you can avoid inceasing custom time-outs for many actions. 

You can set this in: *Settings* / *Content Policy* / *Identify Loading Status*
