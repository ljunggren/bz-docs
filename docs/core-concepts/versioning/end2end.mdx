## An end-to-end example

### Introduction
This guide provides a detailed example of using branches, commits, and merge requests in Boozang, with an emphasis on working with a protected master branch. This ensures a stable and controlled integration of changes.

### Step 1: Initial Setup

#### Setting Up a Protected Master Branch
- **Protect the Master**: In Boozang, configure the master branch as protected, restricting direct commits and merges to authorized personnel only.

#### Creating a Feature Branch
1. **Create a New Branch**: From the master branch, create a new branch for your feature, e.g., `feature-enhancement`.
2. **Switch to Your Branch**: Move to the `feature-enhancement` branch to begin development.

### Step 2: Developing Your Feature

#### Implementing Changes
1. **Develop the Feature**: Work on your feature in the `feature-enhancement` branch, making sure to save and test your progress.
2. **Commit Changes**: Commit your changes with clear, descriptive commit messages, e.g., `Added new UI test cases`.

### Step 3: Preparing for Integration

#### Syncing with Master
1. **Pull Latest Changes**: Regularly pull and merge the latest changes from the protected master branch to your feature branch.
2. **Resolve Any Conflicts**: If conflicts arise during the merge, resolve them promptly.

#### Finalizing Your Work
- **Last Commit**: Once you are satisfied with your feature and it's fully tested, commit any final changes.

### Step 4: Merge Request Process

#### Initiating a Merge Request
1. **Create a Merge Request**: From your `feature-enhancement` branch, initiate a merge request towards the master branch.
2. **Document Your Request**: Clearly describe the purpose and scope of your changes in the merge request.

#### Review and Discussion
- **Engage with Reviewers**: Collaborate with assigned reviewers, responding to comments and making any necessary revisions.

### Step 5: Completing the Merge

#### Final Approval and Merge
1. **Approval from Authorized Personnel**: Wait for the approval from those authorized to merge into the master branch.
2. **Merge Your Changes**: Once approved, the authorized person will merge your changes into the master branch.

#### Post-Merge Steps
- **Verify in Master**: After the merge, test the changes in the master branch to ensure everything works as expected.
- **Close the Merge Request**: Mark the merge request as completed.

### Step 6: Post-Merge Clean-up

#### Cleaning Up Branches
- **Optional Branch Deletion**: Consider deleting the `feature-enhancement` branch if it's no longer needed to keep the repository clean.

### Conclusion
This workflow demonstrates how to effectively use branches, commits, and merge requests in Boozang, particularly with a protected master branch, to ensure high-quality and controlled updates to your project.
