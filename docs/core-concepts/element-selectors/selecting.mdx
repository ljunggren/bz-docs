title: Selecting an element

Boozang uses custom element selectors based on what a user will see rather than classes, ids or other attributes. This means that to use class or id, this usually needs to be explicitly defined. By avoiding using classes and ids as primary identifiers, Boozang tests become very stable to code changes and can automate applications with dynamic ids and classes freely.

###### The element bar

For most actions, the user can select an element (Validations, Events, Javascript and Extract Data). When recording or picking an element Boozang tries to guess the best path to the element. Usually, this is sufficient, but sometimes this needs to be edited. 

###### Re-picking an element

The first step if an action isnÂ´t working as expected is to re-pick the element in the application window. To make sure, double-click the action and confirm that the action is working. 

*Tip: Click on the element dialog and see if the correct element is highlighted in the application window.* 

###### Edit element with DOM picker

If this is still not sufficient, you can try to edit the element. If the current element is not found in the application window, the user will be asked to pick the element. If found, the DOM picker window will be launched which allows the user to fine-tune the element path
