[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eumv5m0rmOI&t=29) Data can be defined on three different levels

[00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eumv5m0rmOI&t=55) Adding and experimenting with different data types

[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eumv5m0rmOI&t=81) Pairs and CSV data are loopable data types for storing and managing data.

[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eumv5m0rmOI&t=113) Matrix data is similar to CSV with a primary key.

[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eumv5m0rmOI&t=145) Boozang allows fetching data from external sources

[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eumv5m0rmOI&t=172) JavaScript to generate data and properties for single named value pairs

[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eumv5m0rmOI&t=201) Arrays in Boozang are powerful and easy to use

--------------

Data is used to be able to create data-driven tests. This means that a test that takes data as input (for instance: "Login" or "Create Project") can be re-used for different data sets. Data handling is at the core of Boozang, and a large variety of data types are supported.
