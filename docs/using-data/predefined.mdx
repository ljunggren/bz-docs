There are also pre-programmed regular expressions in Boozang that can be used. Here is a list of the current ones.

###### Data formatters for date and time

For data and time date, the default data format is `YYYY-MM-DD`, meaning that for 26th of November 2019, `/{today}/`will output `2019-10-26`. You can also input a data format string, separated by a pipe `|`character. Here are some examples,

- No format string: `/{today}/`outputs `2019-10-26`.
- With minutes and seconds dot-colon-notation: `/{today|YYYY.MM.DD:mm.ss}/` will output `2019.10.26:30.29`
- Only month and day:  `/{tomorrow|MM-DD}/`outputs `10-27`

###### Date and time

The following pre-defined expressions are available. All examples are based on today being Saturday, October 26th, 2019. 

-   `/{today}/`outputs `2019-10-26`
- `/{yesterday}/` and  `/{tomorrow}/`and outputs `2019-10-25` and `2019-10-27`
- `/{today-7}/`outputs `2019-10-19`(last week)
- `/{last-mon}/` and `/{last-tue}/` outputs `2019-10-14` and `2019-10-15`
- `/{last-month}/` outputs `2019-09-26`(this date previous month)
- `/{last-year}/` outputs `2018-10-26`(this date previous year)
