<!-- ![refresh](../images/refresh.png) -->

The refresh window/load page action is used to force a reload of the browser window. This can also be used to force loading a new page (meaning going to a new page without having to navigate to it). There is also an option to **Clear Cookies** and **Clear Localstorage**.

**Note**: There are security limitations for the web browser we cannot get around. For instance, the browser does not allow session cookies to be deleted, so this cannot be triggered by the Boozang tool.
