###### The Javascript action

Boozang also allows you to execute Javascript directly in the application. This can be very useful when trying to do more advanced things that aren't covered by the set of actions Boozang has out of the box. 

###### Syntax highlighting

In Javascript mode, you'll get syntax highlighting, similar to a desktop IDE.

###### Debugging Javascript

to debug Javascript, you can add breakpoint directly in the code. This will activate the Chrome browser break-point, and gives you the full capability of the browser debug, such as step forward and inspect data. That means that you'll need to open the browser console to make sure to enable this. 

###### Reference Data

When writing Javascript, there are some particularities in Boozang that need to be respected. To access the application window, you will have to use the handle `$TW (test window)`. This means that to manipulate the application window document tree (DOM), the user needs to use `$TW.document`. When referencing the only document, it references the Boozang tool window, not the application window.

In Boozang, you can reference data directly in Javascript. To access data, use the handles `$project`, `$module`, or `$test`, depending on what level the data was added. For instance, to reference a username that was added on the module level, use `$module.username`. 

###### Function

Boozang also supplies pre-made code snippets for the following common scenarios. 

- Load page
- Browser back, Browser forward
- Scroll to Top, Scroll to Bottom, Scroll one page down and right, Scoll one page up and left
- Retrieve URL

Use these as-is or as starting points for you own custom Javascript commands. 

###### Trouble-shooting

To troubleshoot the application, it's sometimes useful to add debugging code. For instance, to write the contents of the module-level data "username" use `console.log($module.username)` to write it to the tool window and `$TW.console.log($module.username)` to write it to the application window. You can use the Chrome developer tools to verify this.

*Tip: Avoid using `$TW.alert()` as Boozang interprets this as application popup windows and intercepts them.*
