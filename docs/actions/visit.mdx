The visit links action is used to automatically crawl a set of pages based on a navigation bar. To crawl a full navigation panel, such as side navigation or hamburger menu, select this in the **Panel** option. **Target element** defaults to "A" tags but can be changed using the DOM picker in case the navigation contains a different element than regular links. It's possible to execute a script before each click, but this can normally be left blank.

For each click, itÂ´s normal to call a test case. Use **Goto Test Case** to select a downstream test case. This test case will be called for each link in the selected navigation panel.
