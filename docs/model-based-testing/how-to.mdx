We also support model-based testing in Boozang. This allows you to builod a model of the application,
and Boozang will automatically generate the tests. It's usually harder to get started with model-based testing, but after the user manages to create his first workable model, a user can significantly reduce test maintanence effort,
and scale up automation coverage faster.
