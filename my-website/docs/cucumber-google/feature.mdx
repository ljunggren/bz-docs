title: Defining a feature file
---

We start by defining a feature file that describes a simple Google search.

```gherkin
Feature: Google search
	When I go to the Google search page, and search for an item,
	I expect to see some reference to that item in the result summary.

Scenario: Search returns relevant result
	Given that I have gone to the Google page
	When I search "cats"
	Then "cats" should be mentioned in the results

Scenario Outline: Search returns relevant result - data-driven
	Given that I have gone to the Google page
    When I search <searchTerm>
	Then <searchTerm> should be mentioned in the results

Examples

|searchTerm|
|cats      |
|dogs      |
```
