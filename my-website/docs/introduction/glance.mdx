## At the core

Boozang is a code-less front end testing tool built for the modern web using only Javascript. It allows developers and Quality Assurance engineers to develop front-end tests quickly without the need for programming. 

Boozang is not based on Selenium and does not have the limitations of Selenium and Selenium webdriver. Boozang uses its own selection language based on natural language, allowing for native support of TDD / BDD (test/behavior-driven development) and allows for tests to be automatically generated from models (model-based testing). 

## About the Technology

Boozang test technology is divided into two parts. The proprietary part of the tool, that allows you to author tests record fast and the Open Source test runner which is built on Google Puppeteer, which allows you to run tests from command-line and integrate Boozang into your CI flow or other tools.
