# Why use Boozang

## Stable to code changes

Boozang is fundamentally different from other test tools. Boozang uses natural language to identify browser elements, instead of the DOM elements, making tests incredibly stable to changes in the underlying implementation. It's possible to completely change the underlying technology without affecting the tests. You can go from a Java legacy application to Angular or React. The tests remain the same, as long as the business requirements do. 

## Automated documentation

As Boozang is completely based on natural language, all recorded tests are also a user manual. When a label changes, for example: "Create Project" being changed to: "Add Project", the test will need to be updated accordingly. This means the automated tests acts as living documentation. 

## AI test repair

As your code changes, Boozang tests remain stable. If you do change any labels or item identifiers, Boozang will automatically suggest how to repair your tests, or if no suggestion is available, allow you to reselect the element on the page. This reduces test maintenance immensely and allows you to repair broken tests on the fly. 

## BDD / Cucumber support

Built-in support for BDD. Write Gherkin tests directly in our interface, our import them from XRay / Jira. This allows you to write test specifications before the actual code and better distribute the team workload during the project lifecycle. It also allows you to engage business analysts in the testing process, who will have important product knowledge, but might lack in technical skills.

## Versioning, branching and merging

Boozang has built-in versioning, with support for branching and merging. This allows the team to collaborate in teams seamlessly. It also allows the team to align the automation work with the software development process. 

## Linkability

Boozang is completely built-in Javascript, and being Cloud-based, there is no need for any client-side installation. Simply add an HTML fragment to your site to activate it for testing.

## API testing

API testing is supported out of the box, allowing you to create tests that mixes API and UI operations. Automatically generate API tests by recording actions in the browser. 

## Web components / Shadow DOM support and socket-based testing

Supports Web Components / Shadow DOM testing and socket-based testing.
