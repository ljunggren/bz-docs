Boozang supports many application interfaces (for example: management, traffic, store) across many different environments (test, QA, staging, production). The purpose of this is to be able to allow a single test to be re-used across different environments without any risk of having to edit the test. If tests are duplicated and individually customized to run on an environment, over time, maintaining these tests gets very expensive, so itÂ´s better to set this up properly from the get-go.
