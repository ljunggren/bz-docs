###### Why use comment

In some cases, errors can only be spotted by a human, such as UI bugs or poor choice of language. In this case, it can be useful to point this out so a team member on the receiving side can correct this. For these cases, we use the Comment action. 

###### The Comment action

<!-- ![annotation](../images/annotation.png) -->

The comment actions add a comment, or annotation, to the application. To add a comment, click on the Plus icon and select Add Comment, and select the element in the application page to Comment. You can write directly into the Comment dialog on the application.

###### Running a test with comments

When running a test with comments, the test will execute and stop at the first comment. To skip to the  next comment, press play again. This is very useful when fixing look & feel issues, as several issues can be recorded in the same test case. 

###### Show selection for Pass/Fail

Sometimes it's nice to create a checklist for a manual tester to be guided through the application. You can use the Comment action to ask questions to the user and generate success or failure code based on user inputs. Simple click the "Show selection for Pass/Fail" to generate this kind of interactive comment.
