  "description": "As Boozang is completely hosted in the Cloud it's easy to do changes and add useful features quickly. This has a huge upside as we can deploy features that customer asks for to all our customers at the same time, to the benefit of all. This also means that new things can appear in the user interface without warning, and in some cases, the documentation might not be up-to-date all the time.",
